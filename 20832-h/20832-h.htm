<h1>CAMP FIRE GIRLS AT TWIN LAKES</h1>
<p class="center">OR</p>
<h3>The Quest of a Summer Vacation</h3>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2><h3>ABOUT TEETH AND TEDDY BEARS.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Girls, I have some great news for you. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be interested,
and I hope you&#8217;ll be as delighted as I am. Come on, all of you. Gather
around in a circle just as if we were going to have a Council Fire and
I&#8217;ll tell you something that will&mdash;that will&mdash;Teddy Bear your teeth.&#8221;</p>

<p>A chorus of laughter, just a little derisive, greeted Katherine Crane&#8217;s
enigmatical figure of speech. The merriment came from eleven members of
Flamingo Camp Fire, who proceeded to form an arc of a circle in front of
the speaker on the hillside grass plot near the white canvas tents of
the girls&#8217; camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it mean to Teddy Bear your teeth?&#8221; inquired Julietta Hyde
with mock impatience. &#8220;Come, Katherine, you are as much of a problem
with your ideas as Harriet Newcomb is with her big words. Do you know
the nicknames some of us are thinking of giving to her?&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;No, what is it?&#8221; Katherine asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Polly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Polly? Why Polly?&#8221; was the next question of the user of obscure figures
of speech, who seemed by this time to have forgotten the subject that
she started to introduce when she opened the conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Polly Syllable, of course,&#8221; Julietta answered, and the burst of
laughter that followed would have been enough to silence the most
ambitious joker, but this girl fun-maker was not in the least ambitious,
so she laughed appreciatively with the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, anyway,&#8221; she declared after the merriment had subsided; &#8220;Harriet
always uses her polysyllables correctly, so I am not in the least
offended at your comparison of my obscurities with her profundities.
There, how&#8217;s that? Don&#8217;t you think you&#8217;d better call me Polly, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not till you explain to us what it means to Teddy Bear one&#8217;s teeth,&#8221;
Azalia Atwood stipulated sternly. &#8220;What I&#8217;m afraid of is that you&#8217;re
trying to introduce politics into this club, and we won&#8217;t stand for that
a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Julietta, you may have your wish, if what Azalia says is
true,&#8221; Marie Crismore announced so eagerly that everybody present knew
that she had an idea and waited expectantly for it to come out. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
call you Polly&mdash;Polly Tix.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course everybody laughed at this, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span> then Harriet Newcomb demanded,
that her rival for enigmatical honors make good.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it mean to Teddy Bear one&#8217;s teeth?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you girls are making too much of that remark,&#8221; Katherine protested
modestly, &#8220;I really am astonished at every one of you, ashamed of you,
in fact, for failing to get me. I meant that you would be
delighted&mdash;dee-light-ed&mdash;get me?&mdash;dee-light-ed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I get you,&#8221; Helen Nash announced, lifting her hand over her head
with an &#8220;I know, teacher,&#8221; attitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Helen, get up and speak your piece,&#8221; Katherine directed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You referred to the way Theodore Roosevelt shows his teeth when he says
he&#8217;s &#8216;dee-light-ed&#8217;; but we got you wrong. When you said you would tell
us something that would &#8216;Teddy Bear&#8217; our teeth, you meant b-a-r-e, not
b-e-a-r. When Teddy laughs, he bares his teeth. Isn&#8217;t that it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t the first time that Helen Nash has proved herself a regular
Sherlock Holmes,&#8221; Marion Stanlock declared enthusiastically. &#8220;We are
pretty well equipped with brains in this camp, I want to tell you. We
have Harriet, the walking dictionary; Katherine, the girl enigma; and
Helen, the detective.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every girl is supposed to be a puzzle,&#8221; Ernestine Johanson reminded. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t like to snatch any honors away from anyone, but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span> you know, we
should always have the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, let us have the truth about this interesting, Teddy-teeth-baring,
dee-light-ing announcement that Katherine has to make to us,&#8221; Estelle
Adler implored.</p>

<p>&#8220;The delay wasn&#8217;t my fault,&#8221; Katherine said, with an attitude of
&#8220;perfect willingness if all this nonsense will stop.&#8221; &#8220;But here comes
Miss Ladd. Let&#8217;s wait for her to join us, for I know you will all want
her opinion of the proposition I am going to put to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Harriet Ladd, Guardian of the Fire, bearing a large bouquet of wild
flowers that she had just gathered in timber and along the bank of the
stream, joined the group of girls seated on the grass a minute later,
and then all waited expectantly for Katherine to begin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2><h3>A SPECIAL MEETING CALLED.</h3>
</div>

<p>Fern hollow&mdash;begging the indulgence of those who have read the earlier
volume of this series&mdash;is a deep, richly vegetated ravine or gully
forming one of a series of scenic convolutions of the surface of the
earth which gave the neighboring town of Fairberry a wide reputation as
a place of beauty.</p>

<p>The thirteen Camp Fire Girls, who had pitched their tents on the lower
hillside, a few hundred feet from a boisterous, gravel-and-boulder
bedded stream known as Butter creek, were students at Hiawatha
Institute, a girls&#8217; school in a neighboring state. The students of that
school were all Camp Fire Girls, and it was not an uncommon thing for
individual Fires to spend parts of their vacations together at favorite
camping places. On the present occasion the members of Flamingo Fire
were guests of one of their own number, Hazel Edwards, on the farm of
the latter&#8217;s aunt, Mrs. Hannah Hutchins, which included a considerable
section of the scenic Ravine known as Fern hollow.</p>

<p>They had had some startling adventures in the last few weeks, and
although several days had elapsed since the windup in these events and
it seemed that a season of quiet, peaceful camp life was in store for
them, still they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span> sufficiently keyed up to the unusual in life to
accept surprises and astonishing climaxes as almost matters of course.</p>

<p>But all of these experiences had not rendered them restless and
discontented when events slowed down to the ordinary course of every-day
life, including three meals a day, eight hours&#8217; sleep, and a program of
tramps, exercises and honor endeavors. The girls were really glad to
return to their schedule and their handbook for instructions as to how
they should occupy their time. After all, adventures make entertaining
reading, but very few, if any, persons normally constituted would choose
a melodramatic career if offered as an alternative along with an
even-tenor existence.</p>

<p>All within one week, these girls had witnessed the execution of an
astonishing plot by a band of skilled lawbreakers and subsequently had
followed Mrs. Hutchins through a series of experiences relative to the
loss of a large amount of property, which she held in trust for a
relative of her late husband, and its recovery through the brilliant and
energetic endeavors of some of the members of the Camp Fire,
particularly Hazel Edwards and Harriet Newcomb. The chief culprit, Percy
Teich, a nephew of Mrs. Hutchins&#8217; late husband, had been captured, had
escaped, had been captured again and lodged in jail, and clews as to the
identity of a number of the rest had been worked out by the police, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
that the hope was expressed confidently that eventually they, too, would
be caught.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Hutchins is very grateful for the part this Camp Fire took in the
recovery of the lost securities of which she was trustee,&#8221; Katherine
announced by way of introducing her &#8220;great news&#8221; to the members of the
Fire who assembled in response to her call. &#8220;Of course Hazel did the
really big things, assisted and encouraged by the companionship of
Harriet and Violet, but Mrs. Hutchins feels like thanking us all for
being here and looking pleasant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel Edwards, niece of Mrs. Hutchins, was not present during this
conversation. By prearranged purpose, she was absent from the camp when
Katherine put to the other girls the proposition made by the wealthy
aunt of their girl hostess. The reason it was decided best for her to
remain away while the other girls were considering the plan was that it
was feared that her presence might tend to suppress arguments against
its acceptance, and that was a possibility which Hazel and her aunt
wished to avoid. So Katherine was selected to lay the matter before the
Camp Fire because she was no more chummy with Hazel than any of the
other girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s make this a special business meeting,&#8221; suggested Miss Ladd, who
had already discussed the proposition with Katherine and Mrs. Hutchins.
&#8220;What Katherine has to say interests you as an organization. You&#8217;d have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
to bring the matter up at a business meeting anyway to take action on it
and our regular one is two weeks ahead. We can&#8217;t wait that long if we
are going to do anything on the subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a little after 10 o&#8217;clock and the girls had been working for the
last hour at various occupations which appeared on their several routine
schedules for this part of the day. In fact, all of their regular
academic and handwork study hours were in the morning. Just before
Katherine called the girls together, they were seated here and there in
shaded spots on camp chairs or on the grass in the vicinity of the camp,
occupied thus:</p>

<p>Violet Munday and Marie Crismore were studying the lives of well-known
Indians. Julietta Hyde and Estelle Adler were reading a book of Indian
legends and making a study of Indian symbols. Harriet Newcomb and Azalia
Atwood were studying the Camp Fire hand-sign language. Ernestine
Johanson and Ethel Zimmerman were crocheting some luncheon sets. Ruth
Hazelton and Helen Nash were mending their ceremonial gowns. Marion
Stanlock was making a beaded head band and Katherine Crane, secretary of
the Fire, was looking over the minutes of the last meeting and preparing
a new book in which to enter the records of the next meeting.</p>

<p>Everybody signifying assent to the Guardian&#8217;s suggestion, a meeting was
declared and called to order, the Wohelo Song was sung,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span> the roll was
called, the minutes of the last meeting were read, the reports of the
treasurer and committees were deferred, as were also the recording of
honors in the Record Book and the decorating of the count, and then the
Guardian called for new business. This was the occasion for Katherine to
address the meeting formally on the matter she had in mind.</p>

<hr class="major" />
<div style="margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em">

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2><h3>A BOY AND A FORTUNE.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Katherine after all the preliminaries of a business meeting
had been gone through, &#8220;I&#8217;ll begin all over again, so that this whole
proceeding may be thoroughly regular. I admit I went at it rather
spasmodically, but you know we girls are constituted along sentimental
lines, and that is one of the handicaps we are up against in our efforts
to develop strong-willed characters like those of men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t agree with you,&#8221; Marie Crismore put in with a rather saucy
pout. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe we are built along sentimental lines at all. I&#8217;ve
known lots of men&mdash;boys&mdash;a few, I mean&mdash;and have heard of many more who
were just as sentimental as the most sentimental girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were several half-suppressed titters in the semicircle of Camp
Fire Girls before whom Katherine stood as she began her address. Marie
was an unusually pretty girl, a fact which of itself was quite enough to
arouse the humor of laughing eyes when she commented on the
sentimentality of the opposite sex. Moreover, her evident confusion as
she tangled herself up, in her efforts to avoid personal embarrassment,
was exceedingly amusing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would suggest, Katherine,&#8221; Miss Ladd interposed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span> &#8220;that you be
careful to make your statement simple and direct and not say anything
that is likely to start an argument. If you will do that we shall be
able to get through much more rapidly and more satisfactorily.&#8221;</p>

<p>Katherine accepted this as good advice and continued along the lines
suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the main facts are these,&#8221; she said: &#8220;Mrs. Hutchins has learned
that the child whose property she holds in trust is not being cared for
and treated as one would expect a young heir to be treated, and
something like $3,000 a year is being paid to the people who have him in
charge for his support and education. The people who have him in charge
get this money in monthly installments and make no report to anybody as
to the welfare of their ward.</p>

<p>&#8220;The name of this young heir is Glen Irving. He is a son of Mrs.
Hutchins&#8217; late husband&#8217;s nephew. When Glen&#8217;s father died he left most of
his property in trust for the boy and made Mr. Hutchins trustee, and
when Mr. Hutchins died, the trusteeship passed on to Mrs. Hutchins under
the terms of the will.</p>

<p>&#8220;That, you girls know, is the property which was lost for a year and a
half following Mr. Hutchins&#8217; death because he had hidden the securities
where they could not be found. Although Hazel, no doubt assisted very
much by Harriet, is really the one who discovered those securities and
returned them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span> to her aunt, still Mrs. Hutchins seems disposed to give
us all some of the credit.</p>

<p>&#8220;For several months reports have reached Mrs. Hutchins that her
grandnephew has not been receiving the best of care from the relatives
who have charge of him. She has tried in various ways to find out how
much truth there was in these reports, but was unsuccessful. Little
Glen, who is only 10 years old, has been in the charge of an uncle and
aunt on his mother&#8217;s side ever since he became an orphan three or four
years ago. His father, in his will, named this uncle and aunt as Glen&#8217;s
caretakers, but privately executed another instrument in which he gave
Mr. and Mrs. Hutchins guardianship powers to supervise the welfare of
little Glen. It was understood that these powers were not to be
exercised unless special conditions made it necessary for them to step
in and take charge of the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Hutchins wants to find out now whether such conditions exist. At
the time of the death of Glen&#8217;s father, he lived in Baltimore, and his
uncle and aunt, who took charge of him, lived there, too. It seems that
they were only moderately well-to-do and the $3,000 a year they got for
the care and education of the boy was a boon to them. Of course, $3,000
a year was more than was needed, but that was the provision made by his
father in his will, and as long as they had possession of the boy they
were entitled to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span> money. Moreover, Mrs. Hutching understands that
Glen&#8217;s father desired to pay the caretakers of his child so well that
there could be no doubt that he would get the best of everything he
needed, particularly education.</p>

<p>&#8220;But apparently his father made a big mistake in selecting the persons
who were to take the places of father and mother to the little boy. If
reports are true, they have been using most of the money on themselves
and their own children and Glen has received but indifferent clothes,
care, and education. Now I am coming to the main point of my statement
to you.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Hutchins talked the matter over with Miss Ladd and me and asked us
to put it up to you in this way: She was wondering if we wouldn&#8217;t like
to make a trip to the place where Glen is living and find out how he is
treated. Mrs. Hutchins has an idea that we are a pretty clever set of
girls and there is no use of trying to argue her out of it. So that much
must be agreed to so far as she is concerned. She wants to pay all of
our expenses and has worked out quite an elaborate plan; or rather she
and her lawyer worked it out together. Really, it is very interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, she wants us to be real detectives,&#8221; exclaimed Violet Munday
excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t put it that way,&#8221; Julietta Hyde objected. &#8220;Just say she wants
us to take the parts of fourteen Lady Sherlock Holmeses in a Juvenile
drama in real life.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Very cleverly expressed,&#8221; Miss Ladd remarked admiringly. &#8220;Detective is
entirely too coarse a term to apply to any of my Camp Fire Girls and I
won&#8217;t stand for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We might call ourselves special agents, operatives, secret emissaries,
or mystery probers,&#8221; Harriet Newcomb suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we could expect something like that from our walking dictionary,&#8221;
said Ernestine Johanson. &#8220;But whatever we call ourselves, I am ready to
vote aye. Come on with your&mdash;or Mrs. Hutchins and her lawyers&#8217;&mdash;plan,
Katherine. I&#8217;m impatient to hear the rest of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Katherine produced an envelope from her middy-blouse pocket and drew
from it a folded paper, which she unfolded and spread out before her.</p>

<hr class="major" />
<div style="margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em">
<a name="CHAPTER_IV." id="CHAPTER_IV."></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2><h3>THE GIRLS VOTE &#8220;AYE.&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Before I take up the plan outlined by Mrs. Hutchins and her lawyer,&#8221;
Katherine continued, as she unfolded the paper, &#8220;I want to explain one
circumstance that might be confusing if left unexplained. As I said, the
uncle and aunt who have Glen in charge live in Baltimore. They do not
own any real estate, but rent a rather expensive apartment, which they
never could support on the family income aside from the monthly payments
received from Mrs. Hutchins as trustee of Glen&#8217;s estate. This family&#8217;s
name is Graham, and its head, James Graham, is a bookkeeper receiving a
salary of about $1,800 a year. In these war times, when the cost of
living is so high, that is a very moderate salary on which to support a
family of six: father, mother, two girls and two boys, including Glen.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this family, according to reports that have reached Mrs. Hutchins,
is living in clover. Mr. Graham, who is a hard working man, still holds
his bookkeeping position, but in this instance it is a case of
&#8216;everybody loafs but father.&#8217; He is said to be a very much henpecked
husband. Mrs. Graham is said to be the financial dictator of the family.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mrs. Graham seems to be a woman of much social ambition. Among the
necessaries of the best social equipment, you know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span> is a summer cottage
in a society summer resort with sufficient means to support it
respectably and leisure in the summer to spend at the resort. It is said
that the Grahams have all this. They have purchased or leased a cottage
at Twin Lakes, which you know is only about a hundred miles from
Hiawatha Institute. I think that every one of us has been there at one
time or another. It is about three hundred miles from here.</p>

<p>&#8220;What Mrs. Hutchins wants us to do is to make a trip to Twin Lakes,
pitch our tents and start a Camp Fire program just as if we were there
to put in a season of recreation and honor work. But meanwhile, she
wants us to become acquainted with the Graham family, cultivate an
intimacy with them, if you please, and be able to report back to her
just what conditions we find in their family circle, just how Glen is
treated, and whether or not he gets reasonable benefits from the money
given to the Grahams for his support and education.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have given you in detail, I think, what is outlined on this paper I
hold in my hand. I don&#8217;t think I have left out anything except the names
of the children of the Graham family. But there are no names at all on
this paper. The reason for this is that it was thought best not to
disclose the identity of the family for the information of any other
person into whose hands it might fall, if it should be lost by us. The
names are indicated thus: &#8216;A&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span> stands for the oldest member of the
family, Mrs. Graham, for she is two years older than her husband and the
real head of the household; &#8216;B&#8217; stands for the next younger, Mr. Graham;
&#8216;C&#8217; stands for Addie, the oldest daughter; &#8216;D&#8217; for the next daughter,
Olga; &#8216;E&#8217; for the only son, James, named after his father; and &#8216;F&#8217;
stands for Glen. There, you have the whole proposition. What do you want
to do with it? Mrs. Hutchins, I neglected to mention, wants to pay all
of our expenses and hire help to take off our hands all the labor of
moving our camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>Replies were not slow coming. Nearly every one of the girls had
something to say, as indicated by the eager attitudes of all and
requests from several to be recognized by the Guardian, who was &#8220;in the
chair.&#8221; Azalia Atwood was the first one called upon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the proposition of Mrs. Hutchins is simply great,&#8221; the latter
declared with vim. &#8220;It&#8217;s delightfully romantic, sounds like a story with
a plot, and would make fourteen heroines out of us if we were successful
in our mission.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to warn you against one danger,&#8221; Miss Ladd interposed at this
point. &#8220;The natural thing for you to do at the start, after hearing this
lengthy indictment of the Graham family, is to conclude that they are a
bad lot and to feel an eagerness to set out to prove it. Now, I admit
that that is my feeling in this matter, but I know also that there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
possibility of mistake. The Grahams may be high class people, but they
may have enemies who are trying to injure them. If you take up the
proposition of Mrs. Hutchins, you must keep this possibility in mind,
for unless you do, you might do not only the Grahams a great injustice,
but little Glen as well. It would be a pity to tear him away from a
perfectly good home that has been vilified by false accusations made by
unscrupulous enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>The discussion was continued for nearly an hour, the written
instructions in Katherine&#8217;s possession were read aloud and then a vote
was taken. It was unanimous, in favor of performing the task proposed by
Mrs. Hutchins.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2><h3>HONORS AND SPIES.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t this expedition be arranged so that we girls could all win
some honors out of it?&#8221; Ruth Hazelton inquired, after the details of
Mrs. Hutchins&#8217; plan had been discussed thoroughly and the vote had been
taken.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a good suggestion,&#8221; said Miss Ladd. &#8220;What kind of honors would
you propose, Ruth?&#8221;</p>

<p>The latter was silent for some minutes. She was going over in her mind
the list of home-craft, health-craft, camp-craft, hand-craft,
nature-lore, business and patriotism honors provided for by the
organization, but none of them seemed to fit in with the program of the
proposed secret investigation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think of any,&#8221; she said at last. &#8220;There aren&#8217;t any, are there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, there are not,&#8221; the Guardian replied. &#8220;But now is the time for the
exercise of a little ingenuity. Who speaks first with an idea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have one,&#8221; announced Ethel Zimmerman eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what is it, Ethel?&#8221; Miss Ladd inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Local honors,&#8221; replied the girl with the first idea. &#8220;Each Camp Fire is
authorized to create local honors and award special beads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span> and other
emblems to those who make the requirements.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Under what circumstances is such a proceeding authorized?&#8221; was Miss
Ladd&#8217;s next question.</p>

<p>&#8220;When it is found that local conditions call for the awarding of honors
not provided for in the elective list.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do such honors count for anything in the qualifications for higher
rank?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They do not,&#8221; Ethel answered like a pupil who had learned her lesson
very well and felt no hesitancy in making her recitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of honor would you confer on me if I exhibited great skill in
spying on someone else?&#8221; asked Helen Nash in her usual cool and
deliberate manner.</p>

<p>A problematical smile lit up the faces of several of the girls who
caught the significance of this suggestion. Miss Ladd smiled, too, but
not so problematically.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean to point out the incongruity of honors and spies, I presume,&#8221;
the Guardian interpreted, addressing Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very seriously,&#8221; the latter replied with an expression of dry
humor. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t resist the temptation to ask the question and,
moreover, it occurred to me that a little discussion on the subject of
honors and spies might help to complete our study of the problem before
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that we are going to be spies?&#8221; Violet Munday questioned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course we are,&#8221; Helen replied, with a half-twinkle in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the idea of spying on anybody and would rather call it
something else,&#8221; said Marie Crismore. &#8220;First someone calls us detectives
and then somebody calls us spies. What next? Ugh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you like to spy on anybody?&#8221; asked Harriet Newcomb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Marie answered hesitatingly; &#8220;you know that there are thousands
of foreign spies in this country trying to help our enemies in Europe,
and I don&#8217;t like to be classed with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s patriotic,&#8221; said Helen, the twinkle in her eyes becoming
brighter. &#8220;But you must remember that there are spies and spies, good
spies and bad spies. All of our law-enforcement officials are spies in
their attempts to crush crime. Your mother was a spy when she watched
you as a little tot stealing into the pantry to poke your fist into the
jam. That is what Mrs. Hutchins suspects is taking place now. Someone
has got his or her fist in the jam. We must go and peek in through the
pantry door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if you put it that way, it&#8217;ll be lots of fun,&#8221; Marie
exclaimed eagerly. &#8220;I&#8217;d just like to catch &#8217;em with their fists
all&mdash;all&mdash;smeared!&#8221;</p>

<p>She brought the last word out so ecstatically that everybody laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you have fallen into the pit that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span> warned you against,&#8221;
Miss Ladd said, addressing Marie. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t start out eager to prove
the persons, under suspicion, guilty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we must drive out of our minds the picture of the fists smeared
with jam,&#8221; deplored Marie with a playful pout.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear that you must,&#8221; was the smiling concurrence of the Guardian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well; I&#8217;m a good soldier,&#8221; said Marie, straightening up as if
ready to &#8220;shoulder arms.&#8221; &#8220;I won&#8217;t imagine any jam until I see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here comes Hazel,&#8221; cried Julietta, and everybody looked in the
direction indicated.</p>

<p>Hazel Edwards had taken advantage of this occasion to go to her aunt&#8217;s
house and thence to the city Red Cross headquarters for a new supply of
yarn for their army and navy knitting. As she emerged from the timber
and continued along the edge of the woods toward the site of the camp,
the assembled campers could see that she carried a good-sized bundle
under one arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s got some more yarn, and we can now take up our knitting again,&#8221;
said Ethel Zimmerman, who had proved herself to be the most rapid of all
the members of the Camp Fire with the needles.</p>

<p>Although the business of the meeting was finished, by tacit agreement
those present decided not to adjourn until Hazel arrived and received
official notice of what had been done.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m delighted with your decision,&#8221; Hazel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span> said eagerly. &#8220;And, do you
know, I believe we are going to have some adventure. I&#8217;ve been talking
the matter over with Aunt Hannah and she has told me a lot of very
interesting things. But when do you want to go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t discussed that yet,&#8221; Miss Ladd replied. &#8220;I suppose we could
go almost any time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go at once,&#8221; proposed Marion Stanlock. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t anything to
keep us here and we can come back as soon as&mdash;as soon as we find the jam
on somebody&#8217;s fist.&#8221;</p>

<p>This figure of speech called for an explanation for Hazel&#8217;s benefit.
Then Ruth Hazelton moved that the Camp Fire place itself at Mrs.
Hutchins&#8217; service to leave for Twin Lakes as soon as she thought best,
and this motion was carried unanimously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I move that Katherine Crane be appointed a committee of one to notify
Mrs. Hutchins of our action and get instructions from her for our next
move,&#8221; said Violet Munday.</p>

<p>&#8220;Second the motion,&#8221; said Azalia Atwood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Question!&#8221; shouted Harriet Newcomb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those in favor say aye,&#8221; said Miss Ladd.</p>

<p>A hearty chorus of &#8220;ayes&#8221; was the response.</p>

<p>&#8220;Contrary minded, no.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ayes have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The meeting adjourned.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2><h3>A TELEGRAM EN ROUTE.</h3>
</div>

<p>At 9 o&#8217;clock in the morning two days later, a train of three coaches,
two sleepers and a parlor car, pulled out of Fairberry northwest bound.
It was a clear midsummer day, not oppressively warm. The atmosphere had
been freshened by a generous shower of rain a few hours before sunup.</p>

<p>In the parlor car near one end sat a group of thirteen girls and one
young woman. The latter, Miss Ladd, Guardian of Flamingo Camp Fire, we
will hereafter designate as &#8220;one of the girls.&#8221; She was indeed scarcely
more than a girl, having passed her voting majority by less than a year.</p>

<p>The last two days had been devoted principally to preparations for this
trip. Mrs. Hutchins had engaged two men who struck the tents and packed
these and all the other camp paraphernalia and expressed the entire
outfit to Twin Lakes station. On the morning before us, Mrs. Hutchins
accompanied the fourteen girls to the train at the Fairberry depot and
bade them good-bye and wished them success in their enterprise.</p>

<p>There were few other passengers in the parlor car when the Camp Fire
Girls entered. One old gentleman obligingly moved forward from a seat at
the rear end, and the new passengers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span> were able to occupy a section all
by themselves.</p>

<p>Before starting for the train, Miss Ladd called her little flock of
&#8220;spies&#8221; together and gave them a short lecture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, girls,&#8221; she said with keen deliberation, &#8220;we are about to embark
on a venture that has in it elements which will put many of your
qualities to severe test. And these tests are going to begin right away.
Perhaps the first will be a test of your ability to hold your tongues.
That&#8217;s pretty hard for a bevy of girls who like to talk better than
anything else, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really mean to accuse us of liking to talk better than anything
else?&#8221; inquired Marie Crismore, flushing prettily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say so, did I?&#8221; was the Guardian&#8217;s answering query.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly. But you meant it, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I refuse to be pinned down to an answer,&#8221; replied Miss Ladd, smiling
enigmatically. &#8220;I suspect that if I leave you something to guess about
on that subject it may sink in deeper. Now, can any of you surmise what
specifically I am driving at?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody ventured an answer, and Miss Ladd continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk about our mission to Twin Lakes except on secret occasions.
Don&#8217;t drop remarks now and then or here and there that may be overheard
and make someone listen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span> for more. For instance, on the train, forget
that you are on anything except a mere pleasure trip or Camp Fire
excursion. Be absolutely certain that you don&#8217;t drop any remarks that
might arouse anybody&#8217;s curiosity or suspicion. It might, you know, get
to the very people whom we wish to keep in ignorance concerning our
moves and motives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you are bound to make sure enough spies out of us,&#8221; said Marie
Crismore pertly. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to start out with the determination of
pulling my hat down over my eyes, hiding in every shadow I see and
peeking around every corner I can get to. Oh, I&#8217;m going to be some
sleuth, believe me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you say when you catch somebody with jam on his fingers?&#8221;
Harriet Newcomb inquired.</p>

<p>Marie leaned forward eagerly and answered dramatically:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll suddenly appear before the villain and shout: &#8216;Halt, you are my
prisoner! Throw up your jammed hands!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>After the laugh that greeted this response subsided, Miss Ladd closed
her lecture thus:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you all appreciate the importance now of keeping your thoughts
to yourselves except when we are in conference. I&#8217;m glad to see you have
a lot of fun over this subject, but don&#8217;t let your gay spirits cause you
to permit any unguarded remarks to escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the train the girls all got out their knitting, and soon their
needles were plying merrily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span> away on sleeveless sweaters, socks,
helmets, and wristlets for the boys at the front, timing their work by
their wrist watches for patriotism honors. True to their resolve,
following Miss Ladd&#8217;s warning lecture, they kept the subject of their
mission out of their conversation, and it is probable that no reference
to it would have been made during the entire 300-mile journey if
something had not happened which forced it keenly to the attention of
every one of them.</p>

<p>The train on which they were traveling was a limited and the first stop
was fifty miles from Fairberry. A few moments after the train stopped, a
telegraph messenger walked into the front entrance of the parlor car and
called out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Telegram for Miss Harriet Ladd.&#8221;</p>

<p>The latter arose and received the message, signed the receipt blank, and
tore open the envelope. Imagine her astonishment as she read the
following:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Harriet Ladd, parlor car, Pocahontas Limited: Attorney Pierce
Langford is on your train, first coach. Bought ticket for Twin Lakes.
Small man, squint eyes, smooth face. Watch out for him. Letter follows
telegram. Mrs. Hannah Hutchins.&#8221;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2><h3>A DOUBLE-ROOM MYSTERY.</h3>
</div>

<p>Miss Ladd passed the telegram around among the girls after writing the
following explanation at the foot of the message:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pierce Langford is the Fairberry attorney that represented scheming
relatives of Mrs. Hutchins&#8217; late husband, who attempted to force money
out of her after the disappearance of the securities belonging to Glen
Irving&#8217;s estate. Leave this matter to me and don&#8217;t talk about it until
we reach Twin Lakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing further was said about the incident during the rest of the
journey, as requested by Miss Ladd. The girls knitted, rested, chatted,
read, and wrote a few postcards or &#8220;train letters&#8221; to friends. But
although there was not a word of conversation among the Camp Fire
members relative to the passenger named in Mrs. Hutchins&#8217; telegram, yet
the subject was not absent from their minds much of the time.</p>

<p>They were being followed! No other construction could be put upon the
telegram. But for what purpose? What did the unscrupulous lawyer&mdash;that
was the way Mrs. Hutchins had once referred to Pierce Langford&mdash;have in
mind to do? Would he make trouble for them in any way that would place
them in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span> embarrassing position? These girls had had experiences in
the last year which were likely to make them apprehensive of almost
anything under such circumstances as these.</p>

<p>Warned of the presence on the train of a probable agent of the family
that Mrs. Hutchins had under suspicion, the girls were constantly on the
alert for some evidence of his interest in them and their movements. And
they were rewarded to this extent: In the course of the journey,
Langford paid the conductor the extra mileage for parlor car privileges,
and as he transferred from the coach, not one of the Flamingoites failed
to observe the fact that in personal appearance he answered strikingly
the description of the man referred to in the telegram received by Miss
Ladd.</p>

<p>The squint-eyed man of mystery, in the coolest and most nonchalant
manner, took a seat a short distance in front of the bevy of knitting
Camp Fire Girls, unfolded a newspaper and appeared to bury himself in
its contents, oblivious to all else about him.</p>

<p>Half an hour later he arose and left the car, passing out toward the
rear end of the train. Another half hour elapsed and he did not
reappear. Then Katherine Crane and Hazel Edwards put away their knitting
and announced that they were going back into the observation car and
look over the magazines. They did not communicate to each other their
real purpose in making this move, but neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span> had any doubt as to what
was going on in the mind of the other. Marie Crismore looked at them
with a little squint of intelligence and said as she arose from her
chair:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll go, too, for a change.&#8221;</p>

<p>But this is what she interpolated to herself:</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re going back there to spy, and I think I&#8217;ll go and spy, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>They found Langford in the observation car, apparently asleep in a
chair. Katherine, who entered first, declared afterwards that she was
positive she saw him close his eyes like a flash and lapse into an
appearance of drowsiness, but if she was not in error, his subsequent
manner was a very clever simulation of midday slumber. Three or four
times in the course of the next hour he shifted his position and half
opened his eyes, but drooped back quickly into the most comfortable
appearance of somnolent lassitude.</p>

<p>The three girls were certain that all this was pure &#8220;make-believe,&#8221; but
they did not communicate their conviction to each other by look or
suggestion of any kind. They played their part very well, and it is
quite possible that Langford, peeking through his eyewinkers, was
considerably puzzled by their manner. He had no reason to believe that
he was known to them by name or reputation, much less by personal
appearance.</p>

<p>It was in fact a game of spy on both sides during most of the journey,
with little but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span> mystifying results. The train reached Twin Lakes at
about sundown, and even then the girls had discovered no positive
evidence as to the &#8220;squint-eyed man&#8217;s&#8221; purpose in taking the trip they
were taking. And Langford, as he left the train, could not confidently
say to himself that he had detected any suggestion of interest on their
part because of his presence on the train.</p>

<p>Flamingo Camp Fire rode in an omnibus to the principal hotel in the
town, the Crandell house, and were assigned to rooms on the second
floor. They had had their supper on the train and proceeded at once to
prepare for a night&#8217;s rest. Still no words were exchanged among them
relative to the purpose of their visit or the mysterious, squint-eyed
passenger concerning whom all of them felt an irrepressible curiosity
and not a little apprehension.</p>

<p>Miss Ladd occupied a room with Katherine Crane. After making a general
survey of the floor and noting the location of the rooms of the other
girls, they entered their own apartment and closed the door. Marie
Crismore and Julietta Hyde occupied the room immediately south of
theirs, but to none of them had the room immediately north been
assigned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if the next room north is occupied,&#8221; Katherine remarked as she
took off her hat and laid it on a shelf in the closet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone is entering now,&#8221; Miss Ladd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span> whispered, lifting her hand with a
warning for low-toned conversation.</p>

<p>The exchange of a few indistinct words between two persons could be
heard; then one of them left, and the other was heard moving about in
the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one of the hotel men who just brought a new guest up,&#8221; Katherine
remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m going to find out who it is,&#8221; the Guardian declared in a low
tone, turning toward the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you,&#8221; said Katherine, and together they went down to the
office.</p>

<p>They sought the register at once and began looking over the list of
arrivals. Presently Miss Ladd pointed with her finger the following
registration:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pierce Langford, Fairberry, Room 36.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Ladd and Katherine occupied Room 35.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything you wish, ladies?&#8221; asked the proprietor, who stood behind the
desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Miss Ladd answered. &#8220;We want another room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to give you single rooms, if that one is not satisfactory,&#8221;
was the reply. &#8220;All my double rooms are filled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t 36 a double room?&#8221; Katherine inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but it&#8217;s occupied. I just sent a man up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse the question,&#8221; Miss Ladd said curiously; &#8220;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span> why did you put
one person in a double room when it was the only double room you had and
there were vacant single rooms in the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>The hotel keeper smiled pleasantly, as if the question was the simplest
in the world to answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he insisted on having it and paid me double rate in advance,&#8221;
was the landlord&#8217;s startling reply.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2><h3>PLANNING IN SECRET.</h3>
</div>

<p>Without a word of comment relative to this remarkable information, Miss
Ladd turned and started back upstairs, and Katherine followed. In the
hall at the upper landing, the Guardian whispered thus in the ear of her
roommate:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh! Don&#8217;t say a word or commit an act that could arouse suspicion. He&#8217;s
probably listening, or looking, or both. Just forget this subject and
talk about the new middy-blouse you are making, or something like that.
Don&#8217;t gush, either, or he may suspect your motive. We want to throw him
off the track if possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Katherine preferred to say little, for she was tired, and made haste
to get into bed. It was not long before the subject of their plans and
problems and visions of spies and &#8220;jam-stained fists&#8221; were lost in the
lethe of dreamland.</p>

<p>They were awakened in the morning by the first breakfast bell and arose
at once. They dressed hurriedly and went at once to the dining-room,
where they found two of the girls ahead of them. The others appeared
presently.</p>

<p>As the second bell rang, Pierce Langford sauntered into the room and
took a seat near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span> the table occupied by Helen Nash and Violet Munday. He
looked about him in a half-vacant inconsequential way and then began to
&#8220;jolly&#8221; the waitress, who approached and sung off a string of alternates
on the &#8220;Hooverized&#8221; bill of fare which she carried in her mind. She
coldly ignored his &#8220;jollies,&#8221; for it was difficult for Langford to be
pleasing even when he tried to be pleasant, took his order, and
proceeded on her way.</p>

<p>The girls paid no further attention to the supposed spy-lawyer during
breakfast, and the latter appeared to pay no further attention to them.
After the meal, Miss Ladd called the girls together and suggested that
they take a walk. Then she dismissed them to prepare. Twenty minutes
later they reassembled, clad in khaki middy suits, brown sailor hats,
and hiking shoes, and the walk was begun along a path that led down a
wooded hill behind the hotel and toward the nearest lake.</p>

<p>It was not so much for exercise and fresh air that this &#8220;hike&#8221; was taken
as for an opportunity to hold a conference where there was little
likelihood of its being overheard. They picked a grassy knoll near the
lake, shaded by a border of oak and butternut trees, and sat down close
together in order that they might carry on a conversation in subdued
tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Miss Ladd, &#8220;we&#8217;ll begin to form our plans. You all realize,
I think, that we have an obstacle to work against that we did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span> not
reckon on when we started. But that need not surprise us. In fact, as I
think matters over, it would have been surprising if something of the
kind had not occurred. This man Langford is undoubtedly here to block
our plans. If that is true, in a sense it is an advantage to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Hazel Edwards inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the idea of answering questions of that kind without
giving you girls an opportunity to answer them,&#8221; the Guardian returned.
&#8220;Now, who can tell me why it is an advantage to us to be followed by
someone in the employ of the people whom we have been sent to
investigate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can answer it,&#8221; Hazel said quickly, observing that two or
three of the other girls seemed to have something to say. &#8220;Let me speak
first, please. I asked the foolish question and want a chance to redeem
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t call it foolish,&#8221; was the Guardian&#8217;s reassuring reply. &#8220;It
was a very natural question and one that comparatively few people would
be able to answer without considerable study. And yet, it is simple
after you once get it. But go ahead and redeem yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact that someone has been put on our trail to watch us is pretty
good evidence that something wrong is going on,&#8221; said Hazel. &#8220;You warned
us not to be sure that anybody is guilty until we see the jam on his
fist. But we can work more confidently if we are reasonably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span> certain
that there is something to work for. If this man Langford is in the
employ of the Grahams and is here watching us for them, we may be
reasonably certain that Aunt Hannah was right in her suspicions about
the way little Glen is being treated, may we not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is very good, Hazel,&#8221; Miss Ladd commented enthusiastically. &#8220;Many
persons a good deal older than you could not have stated the situation
as clearly as you have stated it. Yes, I think I may say that I am
almost glad that we are being watched by a spy.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t call you out here to have a long talk with you, girls.
There really isn&#8217;t much to say right now. First I wanted you all to
understand clearly that we are being watched and for what purpose.
Langford convicted himself when he asked for the double room next to the
one occupied by Katherine and me and offered to pay the regular rate for
two. He thinks that he is able to maintain an appearance of utter
disinterest in us and throw us off our guard. But he overdoes the thing.
He makes too big an effort to appear unconscious of our presence. It
doesn&#8217;t jibe at all with the expression of decided interest I have
caught on his face on two or three occasions. And I flatter myself that
I successfully concealed my interest in his interest in us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, there are two things I want to say to you, and we will return.
First, do your best, every one of you, to throw Langford off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span> the track
by affecting the most innocent disinterest in him as of no more
importance to us than the most obscure tourist on earth. Don&#8217;t overdo
it. Just make yourselves think that he is of no consequence and act
accordingly without putting forth any effort to do so. The best way to
effect this is to forget all about our mission when he is around.</p>

<p>&#8220;Second, we must find out where the Graham cottage is and then determine
where we want to locate our camp&mdash;somewhere in the vicinity of the
Graham cottage, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me go out on a scouting expedition to find out where they live,&#8221;
Katherine requested.</p>

<p>&#8220;And let me go with her,&#8221; begged Ruth Hazelton.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; Miss Ladd assented. &#8220;I&#8217;ll commission you two to act as
spies to approach the border of the enemy&#8217;s country and make a map of
their fortifications. But whatever you do, don&#8217;t get caught. Keep your
heads, don&#8217;t do anything foolish or spasmodic, and keep this thing well
in mind, that it is far better for you to come back empty handed than to
make them suspicious of any ulterior motive on your part.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2><h3>FURTHER PLANS.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Now, girls,&#8221; said Miss Ladd, addressing Katherine and Hazel, &#8220;let me
hear what your plan is, if you have any. If you haven&#8217;t any, we must get
busy and work one out, for you must not start such an enterprise without
having some idea as to how you should go about it. But I will assume
that a suggestion must have come to you as to how best to get the first
information we want or you would not have volunteered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we work out an honor plan as we decide upon our duties and how we
are to perform them?&#8221; Hazel inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; the Guardian replied, &#8220;I was going to suggest that very
thing. What would you propose, Hazel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, something like this,&#8221; the latter replied: &#8220;that each of us be
assigned to some specific duty to perform in the work before it, and
that we be awarded honors for performing those duties intelligently and
successfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. I suppose this work you and Katherine have selected may
count toward the winning of a bead for each of you. But what will you do
after you have finished this task, which can hardly consume more than a
few hours?&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Why not make them a permanent squad of scouts to go out and gather
advance information needed at any time before we can determine what to
do?&#8221; Marion Stanlock suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good idea,&#8221; Miss Ladd replied. &#8220;But it will have to come up at
a business meeting of the Camp Fire in order that honors may be awarded
regularly. Meanwhile I will appoint you two girls as scouts of the Fire,
and this can be confirmed at the next business meeting. We will also
stipulate the condition on which honors will be awarded. But how will
you go about to get the information we now need?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;First, I would look in the general residence directory to find out
where the Grahams live,&#8221; Katherine replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that is perhaps the best move to make first. But the chances are
you will get nothing there. Can you tell me why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because there are probably few summer cottages within the city limits,&#8221;
Hazel volunteered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; the Guardian agreed. &#8220;Well, if the city directory fails to
give you any information, what would you do next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Consult a telephone directory,&#8221; Katherine said quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; Miss Ladd exclaimed. &#8220;What then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They probably have a telephone; wouldn&#8217;t be much society folks if they
didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Katherine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span> continued; &#8220;and there would, no doubt, be some sort
of address for them in the &#8217;phone book.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that would give us some sort of guide for beginning our search. We
wouldn&#8217;t have to use the names of the people we are looking for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is excellent!&#8221; Miss Ladd exclaimed enthusiastically. &#8220;If you two
scouts use your heads as cleverly as that all the time, you ought to get
along fine in your work. But go on. What next would you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and find out where the people live. That needn&#8217;t be hard. Then we&#8217;d
look over the lay of the land to see if there were a good place nearby
for us to pitch our tents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; put in Hazel; &#8220;and if we found a good place nearby, we&#8217;d begin
the real work that we came here to do by going to the Graham house and
asking who owns the land.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine again,&#8221; Miss Ladd said. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t do better myself, maybe not as
well. I did think of going with you on your first trip, but I guess I&#8217;ll
leave it all to you. Let&#8217;s go back to the hotel now, and while you two
scouts are gone scouting, the rest of us will find something to
entertain us. Maybe we&#8217;ll take a motorboat ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>They started back at once and were soon at the hotel. Katherine and
Hazel decided that they would not even look for the address of the
Grahams in the directories at the hotel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span> but would go to a drug store
on the main business street for this information.</p>

<p>The other girls waited on the hotel portico while they were away on this
mission. They were gone about twenty minutes and returned with a supply
of picture postcards to mail to their friends. On a piece of paper
Katherine had written an address and she showed it to Miss Ladd. Here is
what the latter read:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stony Point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about three miles up the lake,&#8221; Hazel said. &#8220;We thought we&#8217;d
hire an automobile and go up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do,&#8221; said Miss Ladd approvingly. &#8220;And we&#8217;ll take a motorboat and ride
up that way too, if we can get one. Oh, I have the idea now. We&#8217;ll make
it a double inspection, part by land and part from the lake. We&#8217;ll meet
you at a landing at Stony Point, if there is one, and will bring you
back in the boat. Now, you, Katherine and Hazel, wait here while I go
and find a motorboatman and make arrangements with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you,&#8221; said Violet Munday.</p>

<p>The Guardian and Violet hastened down toward the main boat landing while
the other twelve girls waited eagerly for a successful report on this
part of the proposed program.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2><h3>A TRIP TO STONY POINT.</h3>
</div>

<p>Miss Ladd and Violet returned in about twenty minutes and reported that
satisfactory arrangements had been made for a trip up the lake. They
were to start in an hour and a half.</p>

<p>Then Katherine and Hazel engaged an automobile for a few hours&#8217; drive
and before the motorboat started with its load of passengers, they were
speeding along a hard macadam road toward the point around which
centered the interest of their interrupted vacation plans at Fairberry
and their sudden departure on a very unusual and very romantic journey.</p>

<p>Twin Lakes is a summer-resort town located on the lower of two bodies of
water, similar in size, configuration, and scenery. The town has a more
or less fixed population of about 2,500, most of whom are retired folk
of means or earn their living directly or indirectly through the
supplying of amusements, comfort, and sustenance for the thousands of
pleasure and recreation seekers that visit the place every year.</p>

<p>Each of the lakes is about four miles long and half as wide. A narrow
river, strait, or rapids nearly a mile long connects the two. Originally
this rapids was impassable by boats larger than canoes, and even such
little craft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span> were likely to be overturned unless handled by strong and
skillful canoemen; but some years earlier the state had cleared this
passage by removing numerous great boulders and shelves of rock from the
bed of the stream so that although the water rushed along just as
swiftly as ever, the passage was nevertheless safe for all boats of
whatever draught that moved on the two lakes which it connected.</p>

<p>The lower of the twin bodies of water had been named Twin-One because,
perhaps, it was the first one seen, or more often seen by those who
chose or approved the name; the other was Twin-Two. Geographically
speaking, it may be, these names should have been applied vice versa,
for Twin-Two was fed first by a deep and wide river whose source was in
the mountains 200 miles away, and Twin-One received these waters after
they had laved the shores of Twin-Two.</p>

<p>The road followed by Katherine and Hazel in their automobile drive to
Stony Point was a well-kept thoroughfare running from the south end of
Twin-One, in gracefully curved windings along the east border of the
lake, sometimes over a small stretch of rough or hilly shoreland, but
usually through heavy growths of hemlock, white pine, oak, and other
trees more or less characteristic of the country. Here and there along
the way was a cottage, or summer house of more pretentious proportions,
usually constructed near the water or some distance up on the side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
the hill-shore, with a kind of terrace-walk leading down to a boat
landing.</p>

<p>The trip was quickly made. Stony Point the girls found to be a
picturesque spot not at all devoid of the verdant beauties of nature in
spite of the fact that, geographically, it was well named. This name was
due principally to a rock-formed promontory, jutting out into the lake
at this point and seeming to be bedded deep into the lofty
shore-elevation. Right here was a cluster of cottages, not at all
huddled together, but none the less a cluster if viewed from a distance
upon the lake, and in this group of summer residences appeared to be
almost sufficient excuse for the drawing up of a petition for
incorporation as a village. But very few of the owners of these houses
lived in them during the winter months. The main and centrally located
group consisted of a hotel and a dozen or more cottages, known as &#8220;The
Hemlocks&#8221;, and so advertised in the outing and vacation columns of
newspapers of various cities.</p>

<p>On arriving at &#8220;the Point,&#8221; Katherine and Hazel paid the chauffeur and
informed him they would not need his machine any more that day. Then
they began to look about them.</p>

<p>They were rather disappointed and decidedly puzzled at what they saw.
Evidently they had a considerable search before them to discover the
location of the Graham cottage without making open inquiry as to where
it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span> stood. First they walked out upon the promontory, which had a flat
table-like surface and was well suited for the arousing of the curiosity
of tourists. There they had a good view up and down the bluff-jagged,
hilly and tree-laden coast.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s 11 o&#8217;clock now,&#8221; said Hazel, looking at her wrist-watch. &#8220;The
motorboat will be here at about 1 o&#8217;clock, and we have two hours in
which to get the information we are after unless we want to share honors
for success with the other girls when they arrive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s take a walk through this place and see what we can see,&#8221;
Katherine suggested. &#8220;The road we came along runs through it and
undoubtedly there are numerous paths.&#8221;</p>

<p>This seemed to be the best thing to do, and the two girls started from
the Point toward the macadam highway. The latter was soon reached and
they continued along this road northward from the place where they
dismissed the automobile. Half a mile they traveled in this direction,
their course keeping well along the lake shore. They passed several
cottages of designedly rustic appearance and buried, as it were, amid a
wealth of tree foliage and wild entanglements of shrubbery. Suddenly
Katherine caught hold of Hazel&#8217;s arm and held her back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you hear that?&#8221; she inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did,&#8221; Hazel replied. &#8220;It sounded like a child&#8217;s voice, crying.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;And not very far away, either. Listen; there it is again.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a half-smothered sob that reached their ears and seemed to come
from a clump of bushes to the left of the road not more than a dozen
yards away. Both girls started for the spot, circling around the bushes
and peering carefully, cautiously ahead of them as they advanced. The
subdued sobs continued and led the girls directly to the spot whence
they came.</p>

<p>Presently they found themselves standing over the form of a little boy,
his frightened, tear-stained face turned up toward them while he shrank
back into the bushes as if fearing the approach of a fellow human
being.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2><h3>MISS PERFUME INTERFERES.</h3>
</div>

<p>The little fellow retreated into the bushes as far as he could get and
crouched, there in manifest terror. Katherine and Hazel spoke gently,
sympathetically to him, but with no result, at first, except to frighten
him still more, if possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid, little boy,&#8221; Hazel said, reaching out her hands toward
him. &#8220;We won&#8217;t hurt you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he only shrank back farther, putting up his hands before his face
and crying, &#8220;Don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can be the matter with him?&#8221; said Hazel. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t seem to be
demented. He&#8217;s really afraid of something.&#8221;</p>

<p>Katherine looked all around carefully through the trees and into the
neighboring bushes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine what it can be,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing in sight
that could do him any harm. But, do you know, Hazel, I have an idea that
may be worth considering. Suppose this should prove to be the little boy
for whom we are looking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That could hardly be,&#8221; Hazel answered dubiously. &#8220;Look at his
threadbare clothes, and how unkempt and neglected he appears to be. He
surely doesn&#8217;t look like a boy for whose care $250 is paid every
month.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget what it was that sent us here,&#8221; Katherine reminded. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t
it just possible that this little boy&#8217;s fright is proof of the very
condition we came here to expose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s possible,&#8221; Hazel replied thoughtfully. &#8220;At least, we ought
not neglect to find out what this means.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then turning again to the crouching figure in the bushes, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name, little boy? Is it Glen?&#8221;</p>

<p>At the utterance of this name, the youth shook as with ague.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out, Hazel; he&#8217;ll have a spasm,&#8221; Katherine cautioned. &#8220;He thinks
we are not his friends and are going to do something he doesn&#8217;t want us
to do. Let me talk to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, little boy,&#8221; she continued, addressing the pitiful crouching
figure. &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to hurt you. We&#8217;ll do just what you want us to
do. We&#8217;ll take you where you want to go. Will that be all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>A relaxing of the tense attitude of the boy indicated that he was
somewhat reassured by these words. His fists went suddenly to his eyes
and he began to sob hysterically. Hazel moved toward him with more
sympathetic reassurance, when there was an interruption of proceedings
from a new source.</p>

<p>A girl about 18 years old stepped up in front of the two Camp Fire Girls
and reached forward as if to seize the juvenile refugee with both hands.
She was rather ultra-stylishly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span> clad for a negligee, summer-resort
community, wearing a pleated taffeta skirt and Georgette crepe waist and
a white sailor hat of expensive straw with a bright blue ribbon around
the crown. Hazel afterwards remarked that &#8220;her face was as cold as an
iceberg and the odor of perfume about her was enough to asphyxiate a
field of phlox and shooting-stars.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy ceased sobbing as he beheld this new arrival and his face became
white with fear, while he shrank back again into the bushes as far as he
could get. The girl of much perfume and stylish attire seemed to be
unmoved by the new panic that seized him, but took hold of him and
dragged him roughly out of his hiding place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do be careful,&#8221; pleaded Hazel. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see he&#8217;s scared nearly to
death? You may throw him into a spasm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that any of your business?&#8221; the captor of the frightened youth
snapped, looking defiantly at the one who addressed her. &#8220;He&#8217;s my
brother, and I guess I can take him back home without any interference
from a perfect stranger. He&#8217;s run away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; Hazel said gently; &#8220;but it didn&#8217;t seem to me to be
an ordinary case of fright. I didn&#8217;t mean to intrude, but he&#8217;s such a
dear little boy I couldn&#8217;t help being sympathetic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a naughty bad runaway and ought to be whipped,&#8221; the girl with the
cold face returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span> as she started along a path through the timber,
dragging the little fellow after her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that a shame!&#8221; Hazel muttered, digging her fingernails into the
palms of her hands. &#8220;My, but I just like to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped for want of words to express her feelings not too riotously,
and Katherine came to her relief by swinging the subject along a
different track.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really believe that boy is Glen Irving?&#8221; she inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I suppose not,&#8221; Hazel answered dejectedly. &#8220;You heard that girl say
he was her brother, didn&#8217;t you? Well, Glen has no sister. But, do you
know, I really am disappointed to find that he isn&#8217;t the boy we are
looking for, for my heart went right out to him when I first saw his
crouching form and white face. Moreover, I can hardly bear the thought
of leaving him in the hands of that frosted bottle of cheap Cologne.&#8221;</p>

<p>Katherine laughed at the figure.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve painted her picture right,&#8221; she said warmly. &#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s
follow her. We have as much right to go that way as she has, and we must
go someway anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; lead the way,&#8221; Hazel said with smiling emphasis on the &#8220;way&#8221;
to direct attention to Katherine&#8217;s phonetic repetition.</p>

<p>The latter started along the path that had been taken by the girl and
her frightened prisoner, and Hazel followed. The two in advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span> were by
this time out of sight beyond a thicket of bushes and small trees, but
Katherine and Hazel did not hasten their steps, as they preferred to
trust to the path to guide their steps rather than the view of the
persons they sought to follow. In fact, they preferred to trust to the
element of chance rather than run a risk of arousing the suspicion of
the cold-faced girl with the perfume.</p>

<p>Only once did they catch sight of the boy and his captor in the course
of their hesitating pursuit, and this view was so satisfactory that they
stopped short in order to avoid possible detection if the girl should
look back. A turn in the path brought them to the hip of the elevation
where the ground began to slope down to the lake and near the downward
bend of this beach-hill was a rustic cottage, with an equally rustic
garage to the rear and on one side a cleared space for a tennis court.
At the door of the cottage was the girl with the pleated skirt and white
sailor hat, still leading the now submissive but quivering youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; Katharine exclaimed under her breath. &#8220;Things have turned out
just right. If that should prove to be the Graham home we couldn&#8217;t wish
for better luck. Come on; let&#8217;s back through the timber and approach
this place from another direction. They mustn&#8217;t suspect that we followed
that girl and the little boy.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="major" />
<div style="margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em">

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2><h3>THE MAN IN THE AUTO.</h3>
</div>

<p>Cautiously Katherine and Hazel withdrew from the path into a thicket and
thence retreated along the path by which they had approached the house.
They continued their retreat to the point where the path joined the
automobile road and where grew the thicket within which they had
discovered the frightened runaway child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I tell you what we ought to do,&#8221; Katherine said. &#8220;We ought to
follow this road about a mile, maybe, to get a view of the lay of the
land and then return to this spot, or near it. We can get the
information we want after we learn more of the camping possibilities of
this neighborhood and can talk intelligently when we begin to make
inquiries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when we get back,&#8221; Hazel added, &#8220;we&#8217;ll go to some neighboring house
and ask all about who lives here and who lives there, and, of course,
we&#8217;ll be particular to ask the name of the family where that icy bottle
of perfume lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the very idea,&#8221; Katherine agreed enthusiastically. &#8220;But we
haven&#8217;t any time to waste, for it is nearly 12 o&#8217;clock now, and we have
only a little more than an hour to work in if the motorboat arrives on
time. We&#8217;d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span> better not try to walk a mile&mdash;half a mile will be enough,
maybe a quarter&mdash;just enough to enable us to talk intelligently about
the lay of the land right around here.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked north along the road nearly half a mile, found a path which
led directly toward the lake, followed it until within view of the
water&#8217;s edge, satisfied themselves that there were several excellent
camping places along the shore in this vicinity and then started back.
They had passed three or four cottages on their way and at one of these
they stopped to make inquiries as planned.</p>

<p>A pleasant-faced woman in comfortable domestic attire met them at the
door and answered their questions with a readiness that bespoke
familiarity with the neighborhood and acquaintance with her neighbors.
Katherine and Hazel experienced no slight difficulty in concealing their
eager satisfaction when Mrs. Scott, the woman they were questioning,
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The people who have the cottage just north of us are the Pruitts of
Wilmington, those just south of us are the Ertsmans of Richmond, and
those just south of the Ertsmans are the Grahams of Baltimore, I think.
I am not very well acquainted with that family. I am sure we would be
delighted to have a group of Camp Fire Girls near us and you ought to
have no difficulty in getting permission to pitch your tents. This land
along here belongs to an estate which is managed by a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span> living in
Philadelphia. He is represented here by a real estate man, Mr. Ferris,
of Twin Lakes. He probably will permit you to camp here for little or
nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls thanked the woman warmly for this information and then hurried
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need to call at the Graham cottage now,&#8221; Hazel said as they
hastened back to the road. &#8220;We have all the preliminary information that
we want. The next thing for us to do is to get back to the Point and
meet the boat when it comes in and have a talk with the other girls. I
suppose our first move then ought to be to go to Twin Lakes and get
permission from that real estate man, Ferris, to pitch our tents on the
land he has charge of.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two girls kept up their rapid walk until within a few hundred feet
of the drive that led from the main road to the cottage occupied by the
Grahams. Then they slowed up a little as they saw an automobile
approaching ahead of them. The machine also slowed up somewhat as it
neared the drive. Suddenly Hazel exclaimed, half under her breath:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to stop. I wonder what for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and there&#8217;s something familiar in that man&#8217;s appearance,&#8221;
Katherine said slowly. &#8220;Why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not finish the sentence, for the automobile was so near she was
afraid the driver would hear her. But there was no need for her to say
what she had in her mind to say. Hazel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span> recognized the man as soon as
she did.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful,&#8221; Katherine warned. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let him see that we know him.
Just pass him as you would a perfect stranger.&#8221;</p>

<p>But they did not pass the automobile as expected. Although slowing up,
the machine did not stop, and for the first time the girls realized the
probable nature of the man&#8217;s visit to Stony Point.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Hazel!&#8221; Katherine whispered; &#8220;he&#8217;s turning in at the Graham place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet he&#8217;s come here to warn them against us,&#8221; Hazel returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be something of the kind,&#8221; Katherine agreed, and then the near
approach to the automobile rendered unwise any further conversation on
the subject.</p>

<p>The girls were within 100 feet of the machine as it turned in on the
Graham drive and found that they had all they could do to preserve a
calm and unperturbed demeanor as they met the keen searching gaze of the
squint eyes of Pierce Langford, the lawyer from Fairberry.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2><h3>A NONSENSE PLOT.</h3>
</div>

<p>Katherine and Hazel walked past the drive, into which Attorney
Langford&#8217;s automobile had turned, apparently without any concern or
interest in the occupant of the machine. But after they had advanced
forty or fifty yards beyond the drive, Hazel&#8217;s curiosity got the best of
her and she turned her head and looked back. The impulse to do this was
so strong, she said afterward, that it seemed impossible for her to
control the action. Her glance met the gaze of the squint eyes of the
man in the auto.</p>

<p>&#8220;My! that was a foolish thing for me to do,&#8221; she said as she quickly
faced ahead again. &#8220;I suppose that look has done more damage than
anything else since we started from Fairberry. And to think that I above
all others should have been the one to do it. I&#8217;m ashamed of myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he see you?&#8221; Katherine inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was looking right at me,&#8221; Hazel replied; &#8220;and that look was full of
suspicion and meaning. There&#8217;s no doubt he&#8217;s on our trail and suspects
something of the nature of our mission.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh don&#8217;t let that bother you,&#8221; Katherine advised. &#8220;There&#8217;s no reason
why he should jump to a conclusion just because you looked back at him.
That needn&#8217;t necessarily mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span> anything. But if you let it make you
uneasy, you may give us dead away the next time you meet him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe he knows what our mission here is already,&#8221; was Katharine&#8217;s
fatalistic answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case, you needn&#8217;t worry any more about what you do or say
in his presence,&#8221; said Hazel. &#8220;We might as well go to him and tell him
our story and have it all over with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t agree with you,&#8221; Katherine replied. &#8220;I believe that the worst
chance we have to work against is the probability of suspicion on his
part. I don&#8217;t see how he can know anything positively. He probably
merely learned of our intended departure for Twin Lakes and, knowing
that the Grahams were spending the summer here, began to put two and two
together. I figure that he followed us on his own responsibility.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that his visit at the Graham cottage today is to give them warning
of our coming,&#8221; Hazel added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, very likely,&#8221; Katherine agreed. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to hear the conversation
that is about to take place in that house. I bet it would be very
interesting to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt of it,&#8221; said the other; &#8220;and it might prove helpful to us in
our search for the information we were sent to get.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it strange, Hazel, that your aunt should select a bunch
of girls like us to do so important a piece of work as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span> this?&#8221; Katherine
inquired. This question had puzzled her a good deal from the moment the
proposition had been put to her. Although she had received it originally
from Mrs. Hutchins even before the matter had been broached to Hazel,
she had not questioned the wisdom of the move, but had accepted the role
of advocate assigned to her as if the proceeding were very ordinary and
commonsensible.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you hadn&#8217;t restricted your remark to &#8216;a bunch of girls like us&#8217;, I
would answer &#8216;yes&#8217;,&#8221; Hazel replied; &#8220;I&#8217;d say that it was very strange
for Aunt Hannah to select a &#8216;bunch of girls&#8217; to do so important a piece
of work as this. But when you speak of the &#8216;bunch&#8217; as a &#8216;bunch of girls
like us,&#8217; I reply &#8216;No, it wasn&#8217;t strange at all&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re getting conceited, Hazel,&#8221; Katherine protested
gently. &#8220;I know you did some remarkable work when you found your aunt&#8217;s
missing papers, but you shouldn&#8217;t pat yourself on the back with such a
resounding slap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t referring to myself particularly,&#8221; Hazel replied with a smile
suggestive of &#8220;something more coming.&#8221; &#8220;I was referring principally to
my very estimable Camp Fire chums, and of course it would look foolish
for me to attempt to leave myself out of the compliment. I suppose I
shall have to admit that I am a very classy girl, because if I weren&#8217;t,
I couldn&#8217;t be associated with such a classy bunch&mdash;see? Either I have to
be classy or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span> accuse you other girls of being common like myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite content to be called common,&#8221; said Katherine.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t think you are common, and that&#8217;s where the difficulty comes
in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you be generous and call me classy, and I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;m classy to
keep company with my classy associates, and you can do likewise and we
can all be an uncommonly classy bunch of common folks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we could be talking a string of nonsense like this every time we
meet Mr. Langford, we could throw him off the track as easy as scat,&#8221;
said Hazel meditatively. &#8220;What do you say, Katherine?&mdash;let&#8217;s try it the
next time he&#8217;s around: We&#8217;ll be regular imp&mdash;, inp&mdash; What&#8217;s the
word&mdash;impromptu actors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We mustn&#8217;t overdo it,&#8221; Katherine cautioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. Why should we? We&#8217;ll do just as we did this time&mdash;let
one idea lead on to another in easy, rapid succession. Think it over and
whenever you get an idea pass it around, and we&#8217;ll be all primed for
him. It&#8217;ll be lots of fun if we get him guessing, and be to our
advantage, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel and Katherine reached the Point in time to see the motorboat
containing the other members of the Fire approaching about a mile away.
They did not know, of course, who were in the boat, and as it was deemed
wise not to indulge in any demonstrations, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span> one on either side did
any signalling; but they were not long in doubt as to who the passengers
were. A flight of steps led from the top of the point to the landing,
and the two advance spies, as they were now quite content to be called,
walked down these and were waiting at the water&#8217;s edge when the boat ran
up along the pile-supported platform.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2><h3>SPARRING FOR A FEE.</h3>
</div>

<p>Pierce Langford drove the automobile, in which he made his first trip to
Stony Point, up to the end of the drive near the Graham cottage, and
advanced to the front entrance. The porch on which he stood awaiting the
appearance of someone to answer his knock&mdash;there was no bell at the
door&mdash;was bordered with a railing of rough-hewn, but uniformly selected,
limbs of hard wood or saplings. The main structure of the house was of
yellow pine, but the outer trimmings were mainly of such rustic material
as the railing of the porch.</p>

<p>The front door was open, giving the visitor a fairly good view of the
interior. The front room was large and fairly well furnished with light
inexpensive furniture, grass rugs and an assortment of nondescript,
&#8220;catch-as-catch-can,&#8221; but not unattractive, art upon the walls.
Langford, who was not a sleepy schemer, was able to get a good view of
the room before any one appeared to answer his knock.</p>

<p>It was a woman who appeared, a sharp featured, well-dressed matron with
a challenging eye. Perhaps no stranger, or person out of the exclusive
circle that she assumed to represent ever approached her without being
met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span> with the ocular demand, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pierce Langford recognized this demand at once. If he had been of less
indolent character this unscrupulous attorney might have made a
brilliant success as a criminal lawyer in a metropolis. The fact that he
was content with the limitations of a practice in a city of 3,500
inhabitants, Fairberry, his home town, was of itself indicative of his
indolence. And yet, when he took a case, he manifested gifts of
shrewdness that would have made many another lawyer of much greater
practice jealous.</p>

<p>Attorney Langford&#8217;s shrewdness and indolence were alternately
intermittent. When the nerve centers of his shrewdness were stimulated
his indolence lapsed and he was very much on the alert. The present was
one of those instances. He knew something, by reputation, of the woman
who confronted him. He had had indirect dealing with her before, but he
had never met her. However, he was certain that she would recognize his
name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this Mrs. Graham?&#8221; he inquired, although he scarcely needed to ask
the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; she replied with evidently habitual precision.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Langford&mdash;Pierce Langford,&#8221; he announced, and then waited
for the effect of this limited information.</p>

<p>The woman started. It was a startled start. The challenge of her
countenance wavered;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span> the precision of her manner became an attitude of
caution.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not&mdash;not Pierce Langford of&mdash;of&mdash;?&#8221; she began.</p>

<p>The man smiled on one side of his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;The very one, none other,&#8221; he answered cunningly. &#8220;Not to be in the
least obscure, I am from the pretty, quiet and somewhat sequestered city
of Fairberry. You know the place, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been there and hope I shall never have occasion to go to
your diminutive metropolis,&#8221; she returned rather savagely.</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; the visitor commented with a rising inflection for rhetorical
effect. &#8220;By the way, may I come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; Mrs. Graham answered recovering quickly from a partial
lapse of mindfulness of the situation.</p>

<p>The woman turned and led the way into the house and the visitor
followed. Mrs. Graham directed the lawyer to a reed rockingchair and
herself sat down on another reed-rest of the armchair variety. The woman
by this time had recovered something of her former challenging attitude
and inquired:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Langford, what is the meaning of this visit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very much meaning, Mrs. Graham,&#8221; was the reply; &#8220;and of very much
significance to you, I suspect. I come here well primed with information
which I am sure will cause you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span> welcome me as you perhaps would
welcome nobody else in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham leaned forward eagerly, expectantly, apprehensively.</p>

<p>&#8220;You come as a friend, I assume,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any reason to doubt it?&#8221; the man inquired. &#8220;If it were
otherwise, I must necessarily come as a traitor. I hope you will not
entertain any such opinion of me as that. As long as you treat me
fairly, you&#8217;ll find me absolutely on the square for you and your
interests.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; returned the woman in a tone of voice that could hardly be
said to convey any significance other than the dictionary meaning of the
words. &#8220;But let&#8217;s get down to business. What is this information that
you come here primed with? Has it to do with the old subject?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, very intimately, and with nothing else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221; Mrs. Graham asked with more eagerness than she intended
to disclose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there are some spies in this neck of the woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spies!&#8221; the woman exclaimed, betraying still more of the eagerness she
was still struggling against.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes spies. That&#8217;s exactly what they call themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are they?&mdash;how do you know they are here to spy on me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I overheard their plans. I got wind in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span> roundabout way, as a result
of talk on the part of Mrs. Hutchins&#8217; servants, that there was something
doing, with Twin Lakes as a central point of interest. I suspected at
once that your interests were involved; so I stole slyly, Willie
Hawkshaw-like, up to their rendezvous one night and listened to some of
them as they discussed their plans and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of them,&#8221; Mrs. Graham interrupted. &#8220;How many are there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, a whole troup of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a funny story,&#8221; the woman commented dubiously, searching the
face of her visitor for an explanation of his, to her, queer statements.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all so funny when you hear it in detail,&#8221; Langford returned
quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well hurry up with the details,&#8221; the impatient Mrs. Graham demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no need of being in a hurry,&#8221; the lawyer said with provoking
calmness. &#8220;Business is business, you see, and full confidences should
never be exchanged in a situation of this kind until a contract is drawn
up, signed, sealed, witnessed, and recorded. In other words, I ought to
have an understanding and a retainer before I go any farther.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham had no reason to doubt that this was coming sooner or later,
but she winced nevertheless when it came.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2><h3>LANGFORD GETS A CHECK.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I hope you realize, Mr. Langford, that we are not exactly made of
money,&#8221; Mrs. Graham remarked tentatively by way of meeting the demand
which she read between his words. &#8220;Moreover, we were under heavy expenses
during the last year and you got a good deal of what we paid out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so very much,&#8221; Langford corrected, from his point of view. &#8220;You
must remember that I was working for you through another man and he
handled the pay roll, on which he and I were the only payees, and
naturally he took what he didn&#8217;t absolutely have to give to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how much do you want for this service?&#8221; the woman inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to have at least $25 a day and my expenses,&#8221; the lawyer
answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely out of the question. That&#8217;s several times the amount of our
income from the source you are interested in. And a considerable part of
that has to go for the boy&#8217;s clothing, board and education.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is one of the important points to which I am coming,&#8221; Langford
interrupted. &#8220;I come to inform you that Mrs. Hutchins is very much
interested in how the boy is being clothed and fed and educated, and
also how he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span> is being treated, and she has decided to find those things
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a case of her old suspicions being revived?&#8221; Mrs. Graham asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so; anyway, she&#8217;s mighty suspicious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s been peddling stories to her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something I didn&#8217;t find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think a $25-a-day man ought to find out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps; and perhaps I could have discovered that very thing if I had
thought it wise to spend the time on it. After the mischief was done, it
seemed hardly worth while to expend any effort to find the mischief
maker. I decided it was best to get after the mischief itself and stop
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re right,&#8221; assented Mrs. Graham. &#8220;But it really would be
a lot of satisfaction to know who the traitor is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is no time to waste any of your efforts on revenge. That may come
later, not now. But how about my fee?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ask too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t agree with you. That is a very small fee, compared with what
some attorneys get. Why, I know lawyers who never take a case under $100
a day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s in the big cities, where they are under heavy expenses&mdash;costly
offices and office help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you get your information?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I have traveled and lived,&#8221; the woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span> replied with emphasis on the
last word. &#8220;And I know there are plenty of judges who get only $10 a
day, some less. Now, what do you think of that? Do you think you ought
to get more than a judge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, fudge on the judges,&#8221; Langford exclaimed in affected disgust. &#8220;No
big lawyer will take one of those political jobs. There are lots of big
lawyers making $50,000 or $100,000 a year, and there are few judges
getting more than $10,000.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t pay more than $10 a day, and I can&#8217;t pay that very long.
We&#8217;re under heavy expenses here and in Baltimore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to economize, Mrs. Graham,&#8221; Langford advised. &#8220;Remember, this
special income can&#8217;t last forever. The boy is past 10 years old now, and
if nobody takes it away from you earlier, it will stop when he is 21.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it away!&#8221; Mrs. Graham exclaimed in a startled manner, indicating
that her apprehension had not carried her imagination as far as this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure&mdash;why not?&#8221; the lawyer returned. &#8220;What do you think all this talk
about spies has been leading up to?&mdash;a Christmas present? If Mrs.
Hutchins is suspicious enough to send a lot of spies here to get the
goods on you, don&#8217;t you think she has some notion of taking some sort of
drastic action?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of &#8216;goods&#8217; does she expect to get on me?&#8221; the woman inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you guess?&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine, dream, or suspect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just hurry things along to an agreement tween you and me, and I&#8217;ll tell
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you $10 a day and reasonable expenses. That doesn&#8217;t include
your board; only your carfare and such incidentals when you&#8217;re away from
home. That is all conditioned, of course, on your proving to my
satisfaction that you have the information you say you have. There&#8217;s no
use of my fighting for this income if I have to pay it all out without
getting my benefit from it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try not to be so hard on you as all that,&#8221; Langford reassured the
woman. &#8220;I accept your offer, although it&#8217;s the minimum I would consider.
I suppose you are prepared to give me a check today?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I can give you something&mdash;your expenses thus far and maybe a
little besides. Now hurry up and tell your story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can do it in a few words. Mrs. Hutchins has sent a dozen or more
girls up here to find out how you treat the youngster and if he is well
fed, clothed and educated. She&#8217;s received word from some source to the
contrary and is planning to take him away if she discovers that her
suspicions are true. These spies are all Camp Fire Girls who were
camping on her farm. One of them is her niece. The proof of my statement
that they are here to spy on you is in their plan to camp near your
cottage and cultivate an intimate acquaintance with your family,
particularly your two daughters. Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span> of them were up here looking over
the lay of the ground; maybe they&#8217;re here yet. Undoubtedly you&#8217;ll see
something of them tomorrow or the next day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham&#8217;s eyes flashed dangerously. Langford saw the menace in her
look and manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I am now in your employ as counsel,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll begin giving
advice at once. Cut out this hate business. It&#8217;s your worst enemy. Just
be all smiles and dimples and give them the sweetest con game welcome
imaginable. Pretend to be delighted to meet the bunch of Camp Fire
Girls. Tell them you had long held their organization in the highest
esteem. Take your two daughters into your full confidence. Tell them
they must play their part, too, and play it well. They must be eager to
become Camp Fire Girls and seek to be chummy with the spies.</p>

<p>&#8220;And as for the boy, in whom they are specially interested, you must
treat him as if you regard him the dearest little darling on earth.&#8221;
(Mrs. Graham&#8217;s face soured at this suggestion.) &#8220;No, none of that, or
you&#8217;ll spoil the whole game. Mrs. Hutching means business, and all she
needs to do is to prove a few acts of cruelty and neglect, and any court
in the land will give her speedy custody of the child, in view of the
provisions of his father&#8217;s will, which, you know, are very exacting of
you and very friendly toward Mrs. Hutchins and her late husband. By the
way where are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span> the child and the other members of your family?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My husband is in Baltimore working at his regular employment,&#8221; Mrs.
Graham answered. &#8220;I expect him here next week; his vacation begins then.
My son, James, Jr., went up the lakes this morning with some friends of
his. Addie, my oldest daughter, went to Twin Lakes to do some shopping,
and the other girl, Olga, is in the next room with Glen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, Mrs. Graham, how well is the boy supplied with clothing?&#8221;
Langford inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has some good suits,&#8221; Mrs. Graham replied slowly as if going over
Glen&#8217;s wardrobe piece by piece, in her mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dress him up in his best and get some more for special occasions. You
might be working on some article of clothing for him also. That would
indicate strongly that you are interested in his welfare.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, if you don&#8217;t mind, I will take my check and go. I&#8217;ll be back
again, but don&#8217;t think it advisable to come often. I have prepared a
short telephone cipher code by which we can carry on a commonplace
conversation over the wire and let each other know if all is well or if
trouble is brewing or has already broken. Here is a copy of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham wrote the lawyer a check for $35, and he arose to depart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember,&#8221; he said as he stood facing the woman schemer at the doorway;
&#8220;the success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span> of this little plan of ours rests in the ability of
yourself and other members of the family to play the most spontaneously
genteel game the cleverest persons ever planned. If you fall down on
this, undoubtedly you&#8217;ll lose your handsome side-issue income of $3,500
a year.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he went out, cranked his rented automobile, and drove away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2><h3>LANGFORD CHECKS UP.</h3>
</div>

<p>The twelve girls in the boat landed and proceeded with Katherine and
Hazel up the steps to the top of the Point, where a conference was held.
The two advance scouts reported developments in detail, much to the
interest and delight of the other girls. The progress made thus far was
so encouraging that everybody showed a disposition of impatience at the
first sign of inactivity.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must go right back and get permission from Mr. Ferris to locate our
camp somewhere near the Graham home,&#8221; said Katherine. &#8220;We ought to get
our tents pitched just as soon as possible, and we mustn&#8217;t run any risk
of not being able to find Mr. Ferris today.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it would help to allay their suspicions if we all
remained here a while and looked around as if interested in the scenery
just as tourists?&#8221; Azalia Atwood suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Katherine replied quickly. &#8220;Either that man Langford
suspects us or he doesn&#8217;t. If he suspects us, he has grounds for his
suspicion, and any such attempt to throw him off the track would result
in failure. I think we had better assume that he knows what we are up to
and act accordingly, without appearing to admit it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But won&#8217;t they try to cover up the evidence that we are after?&#8221;
Julietta Hyde reasoned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Of course they will,&#8221; Katherine answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be one of the most interesting features of this adventure,&#8221;
said Helen Nash, who already had a reputation wider than the Camp Fire
circle for natural shrewdness. &#8220;When they begin to do that, we&#8217;ll have
some great fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you point out from the lake the place or places where you think
it would be well for us to locate our camp?&#8221; Miss Ladd inquired,
addressing Hazel and Katherine.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can get a pretty good view of it right from here,&#8221; Hazel replied.
&#8220;It&#8217;s right up the shore between those two cottages which are about the
same distance up from the water and have similar paths and flights of
steps running down to their boat landings. Between those two places is a
stretch of timberland that doesn&#8217;t seem to be used by anybody in
particular. We didn&#8217;t explore it because we didn&#8217;t have time, but it
surely must contain some good camping places. We saw several small open
spots near the road that could be used if nothing better is found. We
must make a thorough inspection, of course, before we select a site, but
that won&#8217;t take long and can be done when we bring our outfit up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought to take a run in the boat along the shore and see if we can&#8217;t
find a good landing place,&#8221; Katherine suggested. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be
delightful if we could find a suitable place on the side of that hill
and overlooking the lake? Let&#8217;s take enough time for that.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good idea,&#8221; said Miss Ladd warmly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s do that at once and
then run back to Twin Lakes. But remember, girls, don&#8217;t say anything
about our mission on the boat. The boatman would be sure to start some
gossip that probably would reach the ears of the very persons we want to
keep in the dark as much as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were soon back in the large canopied motorboat, and Miss Ladd gave
instructions to the pilot. The latter cranked his engine, took his place
at the wheel, and backed the vessel away from the landing. A few moments
later the &#8220;Big Twin,&#8221; as the owner facetiously named the boat to
distinguish it from a smaller one which he called the &#8220;Little Twin,&#8221; was
dashing along the wooded hill-shore which extended nearly a mile to the
north from Stony Point. They obtained a good view of the section of the
shore just north of the Graham cottage and picked out several spots
which appeared from the distance viewed to be very good camping sites.
Then the prow of the boat was turned to the south and they cut along at
full speed toward Twin Lakes.</p>

<p>The run was quickly made, and Katherine and Hazel hastened at once to
the Ferris real estate office and presented their petition to Mr. Ferris
in person. The latter was much interested when he learned that a Fire of
Camp Fire Girls desired permission to pitch their tents on land of which
he was the local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span> agent, and still more interested when informed that
they were students at Hiawatha Institute whose reputation was well known
to him. He gave them a pen-and-ink drawing of the vicinity, indicating
the approximate lines of the lands owned or leased by cottagers then in
possession, and granted them permission, free of charge, to locate their
camp at any place they desired so long as they did not encroach on the
rights of others.</p>

<p>An hour later the squint-eyed man whose activities have already created
much of interest in this narrative entered the office of Mr. Ferris and
inquired:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you agent for that land along the lake just north of Stony Point?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; the real estate man replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you allow campers to pitch their tents on the land for a week or two
at a time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t object if they are all right. I always require some sort of
credentials. I wouldn&#8217;t allow strangers to squat there without giving me
some kind of notice. I granted permission to a bunch of Camp Fire Girls
today to pitch their tents there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so? Where are they going to locate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just beyond the Graham cottage, if you know where that is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is where some friends of mine would like to camp,&#8221; said Langford
in an affected tone of disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d care to grant any more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span> permits in that vicinity,&#8221;
Mr. Ferris announced rather meditatively. &#8220;I feel rather a personal
interest in the girls and don&#8217;t want any strangers to pitch a camp too
near them. Your friends might, perhaps, locate half a mile farther up
the shore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell them what you say,&#8221; Langford said as he left the office.</p>

<p>Five minutes later he was in a telephone booth calling for No. 123-M. A
woman answered the ring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this Mrs. Graham?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Langford. I just called to inform you that the parties we were
talking about have obtained permission to camp near your cottage. You&#8217;ll
probably see something of them tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll be at your place tomorrow afternoon between 3 and 4 o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll expect you.&#8221;</p>

<p>That ended the conversation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2><h3>A DAY OF HARD WORK.</h3>
</div>

<p>That evening Miss Ladd received the letter that Mrs. Hutchins had
announced in her telegram addressed to the Guardian on the train, would
follow that communication. She did not discuss the matter with any of
the girls, but quietly passed it around until all had read it.</p>

<p>In her letter Mrs. Hutchins stated little that had not been read between
the lines of the telegram, although her views and comments on the
circumstances were interesting. She had seen Pierce Langford arrive at
the station just as the train was pulling in, buy a ticket and board the
train just as it was pulling out. Curiosity, stirred perhaps by the
recollection that this man had recently represented interests hostile to
the mission of the Thirteen Camp Fire Girls and their Guardian, and
might still represent those interests, caused her to inquire of the
agent for what point Mr. Langford had purchased his ticket. The reply
was &#8220;Twin Lakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was sufficient. The woman asked for a telegram pad and wrote a few
lines. Then she gave the message to the operator with these directions:</p>

<p>&#8220;I want that to catch Miss Ladd in the limited as soon as possible. Keep
it going from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span> station to station until it is delivered. Have the
operator who succeeds in getting the message into Miss Ladd&#8217;s hands wire
back &#8216;delivered&#8217; as soon as she receives it.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the day following the advance excursion and inspection of the camping
prospects at Stony Point, the &#8220;Big Twin&#8221; was engaged again to convey the
Camp Fire Girls to the prospective camping place. On this occasion the
tents and other paraphernalia were taken aboard and conveyed to the
scene of the proposed camp. The boat skirted along the shore and a
careful examination was made to discover landing places that might
provide access from the lake to such camping sites as might later be
found.</p>

<p>Several good landing places were found. The one they selected
tentatively as a mooring for the boat was a large flat-rock projection a
few hundred yards north of the Graham pier. A comparatively level shore
margin extended back nearly a hundred feet from this rock to the point,
where the wooded incline began. The boatman and a boy of eighteen who
had been engaged to assist in handling the heavier paraphernalia,
remained in the boat while the girls started off in pairs to explore the
nearby territory for the most advantageous and available site.</p>

<p>They came together again half an hour later and compared notes. The
result was that the report made by Marion Stanlock and Harriet Newcomb
proved the most interesting. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span> had found a pretty nook half way up
the side of the hill shore and sheltered by a bluff on the inland side
and trees and bushes at either end, so that no storm short of a
hurricane could seriously damage a well-constructed camp in this place.
The area was considerable, quite sufficient for the pitching of the
complement of tents of the Fire.</p>

<p>After all the girls had inspected this proposed site in a body, a
unanimous vote was taken in favor of its adoption. This being their
decision, they returned without delay to the boat and the work of
carrying their camping outfit a distance of some three hundred yards was
begun.</p>

<p>The pilot and the boy assistant took the heavier luggage while the girls
carried the lighter articles and supplies. In this manner everything was
transported to the camp site in about an hour. The pilot and the boy
then assisted in the work of putting up the tents, and after this was
finished they were paid and dismissed.</p>

<p>Everything went along smoothly while all this was being done. Not
another person appeared in sight during this period, except the
occupants of several boats that motored by. The Graham cottage was about
a quarter of a mile to the south and farther up on the hill, but the
screen of dense foliage shut it off from view at the girls&#8217; camp.</p>

<p>All the rest of the day was required to put the camp into good
housekeeper&#8217;s condition. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span> light folding cots had to be set up and
got ready for sleeping, the kitchen tent also required much domestic art
and ingenuity for the most convenient and practical arrangement, and a
fireplace for cooking had to be built with rocks brought up principally
from the water&#8217;s edge.</p>

<p>So eager were they to finish all this work that they did not stop to
prepare much of a luncheon. They ate hurriedly-prepared sandwiches,
olives, pickles, salmon, and cake, and drank lemonade, picnic style, and
kept at their camp preparation &#8220;between bites,&#8221; as it were. In the
evening, however, they had a good Camp Fire Girls&#8217; supper prepared by
Hazel Edwards, Julietta Hyde and the Guardian. Then they sat around
their fire and chatted, principally about the beauty of the scenery on
every hand.</p>

<p>But they were tired girls and needed no urging to seek rest on their
cots as the sun sunk behind the hills on the opposite side of the lake.
The move &#8220;bedward&#8221; was almost simultaneous and the drift toward
slumberland not far behind. They had one complete day undisturbed with
anything of a mysterious or startling nature, and it was quite a relief
to find it possible to seek a night&#8217;s repose after eight or nine hours
of diligent work without being confronted with apprehensions of some
impending danger or possible defeat of their plans.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2><h3>PLANNING.</h3>
</div>

<p>Next morning the girls all awoke bright and early, thoroughly refreshed
by their night&#8217;s rest. A breakfast of bacon, flapjacks and maple syrup,
bread and butter and chocolate invigorated them for a new day of camp
life in a new place.</p>

<p>Their program was already pretty well mapped out, being practically the
same as that followed while in camp in Fern Hollow near Fairberry. They
still did some work on certain lines arranged under the honor lists of
the craft, but were giving particular attention to knitting and sewing
for the Red Cross, which they aided in an auxiliary capacity.</p>

<p>The program regularly followed by the girls required three hours of
routine work each day. This they usually performed between the hours of
7 and 10 or 8 and 11, depending upon the time of their getting up and
the speed with which they disposed of the early morning incidentals.</p>

<p>On this morning, in spite of the fact that they had gone to bed
thoroughly tired as a result of the exertions of the preceding day, the
girls arose shortly after 6 o&#8217;clock and by 7:30 all were engaged in
various record-making occupations, including the washing of the
breakfast dishes and the making of the beds and the general tidying-up
of the camp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>After the routine had been attended to, the girls took a hike for the
purpose of exploring the country to the north of their camp. This
exploration extended about two miles along the shore, their route being
generally the automobile road that skirted the lake at varying distances
of from a few rods to a quarter of a mile from the water&#8217;s edge,
depending upon the configuration of the shore line.</p>

<p>During much of this hike, Katherine, Hazel and Miss Ladd walked together
and discussed plans for creating a condition of affairs that might be
expected to produce results in harmony with the purpose of their
mission. They were all at sea at first, but after a short and fruitless
discussion of what appeared to be next to nothing, Katherine made a
random suggestion which quickly threw a more hopeful light on affairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me that we&#8217;ve got to do something that will attract
attention,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to do some sensational, or at least
lively, stunts so that everybody will know we are here and will want to
know who we are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the very idea,&#8221; Miss Ladd said eagerly.</p>

<p>Katherine was a little startled at this reception of her suggestion.
When she spoke, she was merely groping for an idea. But Miss Ladd&#8217;s
approval woke her up to a realization that she had unwittingly hit the
nail on the head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, picking up the thread of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span> real idea as she proceeded;
&#8220;we have got to attract attention. That&#8217;s the only way we can get the
people in whom we are most interested to show an interest in us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; Hazel inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Map out a spectacular program of some sort,&#8221; Katherine replied. &#8220;We
might build a big bonfire, for one thing, on the shore tonight and go
through some of our gym exercises, including folk dances.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Hazel. &#8220;Let&#8217;s start off with that. And tomorrow we can have
some games that will make it necessary for us to run all over the
country&mdash;hare and hounds, for instance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought to find a good safe swimming place near our camp, too,&#8221;
Katherine said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s look for one this afternoon,&#8221; Miss Ladd suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;How will we test it?&#8221; Hazel inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy,&#8221; the Guardian replied. &#8220;We&#8217;ll use poles to try the depth
and then one of us will swim out with one end of a rope attached to her
and the other end in the hands of two of the girls ready to haul in if
she needs assistance. In that way we will be able to locate a good
swimming place and not run any risk of anybody&#8217;s being drowned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a good starter, anyway,&#8221; Katherine remarked in a tone of
satisfaction. &#8220;By the time we&#8217;ve taken care of those items something
more of the same character ought to occur to us. Yes, that&#8217;s the very
way to interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span> the Grahams in our presence and open the way for an
acquaintance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three now separated and mingled with the other girls who were some
distance ahead or behind, and communicated the new plan to all of them.
It was received with general approval and was the main topic of
conversation until they all returned to the camp for luncheon.</p>

<hr class="major" />
<div style="margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em">

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2><h3>WATCHED.</h3>
</div>

<p>After luncheon, the girls, with two sharp hatchets among them, began a
search through the timber for some long, slim saplings. After a half
hour&#8217;s search they were in possession of three straight cottonwood
poles, ten or twelve feet long, and with these in their possession, they
began an examination of the water-depth along the shore for a safe and
suitable bathing place.</p>

<p>They might have used their fishing rods for this purpose, but these were
not serviceable, as they were of extremely light material and, moreover,
were hardly long enough for this purpose. The saplings proved to be
excellent &#8220;feelers&#8221; and the work progressed rapidly from the start.</p>

<p>About 200 yards north of their camp was a sandy beach which extended
along the shore a considerable distance. It was here that the girls made
their first under-water exploration. They tied a rough stone near one
end of each of the poles to increase its specific gravity and then
proceeded to &#8220;feel&#8221; for depth along the water&#8217;s edge.</p>

<p>Careful examination with these poles failed to disclose a sudden drop
from the gradual downward slope of the beach into the water, so that
there appeared to be no treacherous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span> places near the shore. Satisfied in
this respect, they now arranged for a further test. Azalia Atwood, who
was an excellent swimmer, returned to the camp, donned a bathing suit,
and then rejoined the other girls, bringing with her a long rope of the
clothesline variety. One end of this was looped around her waist, and
Marion Stanlock had an opportunity to exhibit her skill at tying a
bowline.</p>

<p>While two of the girls held the rope and played it out, Azalia advanced
into the water, stepping ahead carefully in order to avoid a surprise of
any sort resulting from some hidden danger under the surface of the
lake. To some, all this caution might seem foolish, inasmuch as Azalia
swam well, but one rule of, Flamingo Camp Fire prohibited even the best
swimmers from venturing into water more than arm-pit deep unless they
were at a beach provided with expert life-saving facilities.</p>

<p>The purpose of Azalia&#8217;s exploration was to wade over as large an area of
lake bottom as possible and establish a certainty that it was free from
deep step-offs, &#8220;bottomless&#8221; pockets and treacherous undertow. Soon it
became evident that she had a bigger undertaking before her than she had
reckoned on, for the bed of the lake sloped very gradually at this
point, and Katherine Crane and Estelle Adler volunteered to assist her.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Azalia, welcoming the suggestion. &#8220;Go and put on your
bathing suits and bring a few more hanks of rope. Better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span> bring all
there is there, for we probably can use it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Katherine and Estelle hastened back to camp and in a short time
returned, clad in their bathing suits and carrying several hundred feet
of rope. In a few minutes they too were in the water and taking part in
the exploration, protected against treacherous conditions as Azalia was
protected.</p>

<p>In half an hour they had explored and pronounced safe as large a bathing
place as their supply of rope would &#8220;fence in&#8221; and then began the
&#8220;fencing&#8221; process. They cut several stout stakes six feet long and took
them to the water&#8217;s edge. Then the three girls in bathing suits assumed
their new duty as water pile-drivers. They took one of the stakes at a
time to a point along the proposed boundary line of the bathing place,
also a heavy mallet that had been brought along for this purpose. A
wooden mallet, by the way, was much more serviceable than a hatchet for
such work, inasmuch as, if dropped, it would not sink, and moreover, it
could be wielded with much less danger of injury to any of those working
together in the water.</p>

<p>The first stake was taken to the northwest corner of the proposed
inclosure. Katherine, who carried the mallet, gave it to Estelle and
then climbed to a sitting posture on the latter&#8217;s shoulders. Then Azalia
stood the stake on its sharpened end and Katherine took hold of it with
one hand and began to drive down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span> on the upper end with the mallet,
which Estelle handed back to her.</p>

<p>It was hard work for several reasons&mdash;hard for Estelle to maintain a
steady and firm posture under the moving weight, hard for Katherine to
wield the mallet with unerring strokes, hard to force the sharpened
point into the well-packed bed of the lake. Katherine&#8217;s right arm became
very tired before she had driven the stake deep enough to insure a
reasonable degree of firmness. While this task was being performed, the
girls were still protected against the danger of being swept into deeper
water by the ropes looped around their waists and held at the other ends
by some of the girls on the sandy beach.</p>

<p>After this stake had been set firmly into the river bed, the girls
returned to the shore and got another. This they took to another
position about the same distance from the beach as the first one and
drove it into the hardened loam under the water. The same process was
continued until six such stakes had been driven.</p>

<p>Then they took up the work of extending rope from stake to stake and
completing the inclosure. The sags were supported by buoys of light wood
tied to the rope, the two extreme ends of which were attached to stakes
driven into the shore close to the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, that is what I call a pretty good job,&#8221; declared Miss Ladd
gazing with proud satisfaction upon the result of more than three hours&#8217;
steady work. &#8220;Whenever you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span> girls come out here to go bathing, you will
be well warranted in assuming that you have earned your plunge.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the girls by this time had their bathing suits on, but most of them
were too tired to remain in the water any longer; so, by common consent,
all adjourned to the camp to rest until suppertime.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it appears that our activities have not yet aroused any special
interest in the Graham household,&#8221; Hazel Edwards observed as they began
their march back toward the sheltered group of tents.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so certain of that,&#8221; Miss Ladd replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; Katherine inquired, while several of the girls who were near
looked curiously at the Guardian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I believe I have seen evidences of interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have!&#8221; exclaimed two or three unguardedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, girls, you are forgetting yourselves,&#8221; said Miss Ladd warningly.
&#8220;Remember that the first requisite of skill in your work here is
caution. The reason I didn&#8217;t say anything to you about what I saw is
that I was afraid some of you might betray your interest in the fact
that we were being watched. I saw two girls half hidden in a clump of
bushes up near the top of the hill. I am sure they were watching us.
They were there at least half an hour.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2><h3>THE MISSILE.</h3>
</div>

<p>Five of the members of the Camp Fire were present when Miss Ladd made
this startling announcement that they had been watched secretly for a
considerable time while roping off the limits of their swimming place.
The other girls had taken the lead back to the camp and were a
considerable distance ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they watching us yet?&#8221; Azalia asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; the Guardian replied. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen any sign of them
during the last twenty minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know they are girls?&#8221; Katherine inquired. &#8220;That&#8217;s quite a
distance to recognize ages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they may be old women, but I&#8217;ll take a chance on a guess that they
are not. The millinery I caught a peep at looked too chic for a
grandmother. I&#8217;ve got pretty good long-distance eyes, I&#8217;ll have you
know,&#8221; Miss Ladd concluded smartly.</p>

<p>There was no little excitement among the other girls when this bit of
news was communicated to them. But they had had good experience-training
along the lines of self-control, and just a hint of the unwisdom of loud
and extravagant remarks put them on their guard.</p>

<p>Some of the girls proposed that the plan of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span> building a bonfire in the
evening be given up and nobody objected to this suggestion. All the
girls felt more like resting under the shade of a tree than doing
anything else, and those who had performed the more arduous tasks in the
work of the afternoon were &#8220;too tired to eat supper,&#8221; as one of them
expressed it. So nobody felt like hunting through the timber for a big
supply of firewood.</p>

<p>The atmosphere had become very warm in the afternoon, but the girls
hardly noticed this condition until their work in the water was finished
and they returned to the camp. After they had rested a while some of the
girls read books and magazines, but little was done before supper.</p>

<p>After supper some of the girls, who felt more vigorous than those who
had performed the more exhausting labor of the afternoon, revived the
idea of a bonfire and were soon at work gathering a supply of wood. They
busied themselves at this until nearly dusk and then called the other
girls down to the water&#8217;s edge, where on a large rocky ledge
arrangements for the fire had been made.</p>

<p>All of the girls congratulated themselves now on the revival of the
bonfire idea, for the mosquitos had become so numerous that comfort was
no longer possible without some agency to drive them away. A bonfire was
just the thing, although it would make the closely surrounding
atmosphere uncomfortably warm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<p>Even the girls who had performed the hardest tasks in the &#8220;fencing in&#8221;
of their swimming place were by this time considerably rested and
enjoyed watching the fire seize the wood and then leap up into the air
as if for bigger prey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s sing,&#8221; proposed Harriet Newcomb after the fire had grown into a
roaring, crackling blaze, throwing a brilliant glow far out onto the
water.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall it be?&#8221; asked Ethel Zimmerman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Burn Fire, Burn,&#8221; Hazel Edwards proposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marion, you start it,&#8221; Miss Ladd suggested, for Marion Stanlock was the
&#8220;star&#8221; soprano of the Fire.</p>

<p>In a moment the well-trained voices of fourteen Camp Fire Girls were
sending the clear operatic strains of a special adaptation of the fire
chant of the Camp Fire ritual. The music had been composed and arranged
by Marion Stanlock and Helen Nash a few months previously, and diligent
practice had qualified the members of the Camp Fire to render the
production impressively.</p>

<p>This song was succeeded by a chorus-rendering of a similar adaptation of
the Fire Maker&#8217;s Song. Then followed an impromptu program of
miscellaneous songs, interspersed here and there with such musical
expressions of patriotism as &#8220;America,&#8221; &#8220;Star Spangled Banner,&#8221; and
&#8220;Over There,&#8221; in evidence of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span> mindfulness of the part of the United
States in the great international struggle for democracy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile dusk gathered heavier and heavier, the stars came out, and
still the fire blazed up brightly and the girls continued to sing songs
and tell stories and drink in the vigor and inspiration of the scene. At
last, however, the Guardian announced that it was 9 o&#8217;clock, which was
Flamingo&#8217;s curfew, and there was a general move to extinguish the fire,
which by this time had been allowed to burn low.</p>

<p>Suddenly all were startled by an astonishing occurrence. A heavy object,
probably a stone as large as a man&#8217;s fist, fell in the heap of embers,
scattering sparks and burning sticks in all directions. There was a
chorus of screams, and a frantic examination, by the girls, of one
another&#8217;s clothes to see if any of them were afire.</p>

<hr class="major" />
<div style="margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em">

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2><h3>&#8220;SH!&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Who in the world do you suppose did that?&#8221; Hazel Edwards exclaimed, as
she hastily examined her own clothes and then quickly struck out a spark
that clung to the skirt of Azalia Atwood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, girls,&#8221; cried Miss Ladd; &#8220;did any of you do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a chorus of indignant denials. No room for doubt remained now
that the missile had been hurled by someone outside the semicircle near
the bonfire.</p>

<p>All eyes were turned back toward the timber a short distance away, but
not a sign of a human being could they see in that direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we&#8217;d been on the other side of the bonfire, we&#8217;d have got that
shower of sparks right in our faces and all over us,&#8221; Katherine Crane
said indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought to find out who threw that rock, or whatever it was,&#8221; Ethel
Zimerman declared. &#8220;It must be a very dangerous person, who ought to be
taken care of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that sort of thing is repeated many times, some of us probably will
have to be taken care of,&#8221; observed Julietta Hyde.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; Miss Ladd interrupted, and the occasion of her interruption
did not call for explanation. All heard it. A moment later it was
repeated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Wohelo!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No Camp Fire Girl ever made such a noise as that,&#8221; said Helen Nash
disdainfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;It sounds like a man&#8217;s voice,&#8221; Azalia Atwood remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet a Liberty Bond that it is a man,&#8221; ventured Ruth Hazelton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you a Liberty Bond?&#8221; asked Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m paying for one out of my allowance,&#8221; Ruth replied.</p>

<p>Just then the &#8220;noise&#8221; was repeated, a hoarse hollow vocalization of the
Camp Fire Watchword. This time it seemed to be farther away.</p>

<p>&#8220;The person who gave that call threw the missile into our bonfire,&#8221; said
Miss Ladd in a tone of conviction. &#8220;If he bothers us any more we&#8217;ll find
out who he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls now turned their attention again to the fire. Several pails of
water were carried from the lake and dashed into the embers until not a
spark remained. Then they returned to their tents and to bed, although
apprehensive of further disturbance before morning.</p>

<p>But they heard nothing more of the intruder that night.</p>

<p>Shortly after sunup, the girls arose, put on their bathing suits, and
went down to the beach for a before-breakfast plunge. Marie Crismore and
Violet Munday reached the water&#8217;s edge first, and presently they were
giving utterance to such unusual expressions, indicative seemingly of
anything but pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span> that the other girls hastened down to see what
was the matter.</p>

<p>There was no need of explanation. The evidence was before them. The
stakes that had been driven into the bed of the lake to hold the rope
intended to indicate the safety limit had been pulled out and thrown
upon the shore. The rope itself had disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;There surely are some malicious mischief makers in this vicinity,&#8221;
Helen Nash observed. &#8220;I suppose the person who did that was the one who
threw a stone into our bonfire and hooted our watchword so hideously.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; Violet Munday questioned. &#8220;We can&#8217;t let this sort of
thing go on indefinitely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must complain to the authorities,&#8221; Ernestine Johanson suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose they would do anything?&#8221; Estelle Adler asked. &#8220;I
understand it&#8217;s very hard to get these country officials busy on
anything except a murder or a robbery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we must organize a series of relief watches and take the law into
our own hands,&#8221; Katherine proposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spoken like a true soldier,&#8221; commented Miss Ladd approvingly. &#8220;I was
going to suggest something of the same sort, although not quite so much
like anarchy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you suppose they hid that rope?&#8221; Marion Stanlock inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody probably needed a clothesline.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here come some people who may be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span> to throw some light on the
situation,&#8221; said Marion.</p>

<p>All looked up and saw two girls apparently in their &#8220;upper teens,&#8221;
dressed more suitably for an afternoon tea than a rustic outing. The
latter were descending the wooded hill-shore, and had just emerged from
a thick arboreal growth into a comparatively clear area a hundred yards
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh!&#8221; Katherine warned quickly. &#8220;Be careful what you say or do. Those
are the Graham girls.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2><h3>THE GRAHAM GIRLS CALL.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re early risers; we must say that much for them,&#8221; observed
Katherine in a low voice. &#8220;We must give them credit for not lying in bed
until 10 o&#8217;clock and, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And for dressing for an afternoon party before breakfast,&#8221; Helen Nash
concluded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it funny!&#8221; Hazel Edwards said with a suppressed titter. &#8220;I wonder
if they are going in bathing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep still, girls,&#8221; Miss Ladd interposed. &#8220;They&#8217;re getting pretty near.
Let&#8217;s not pay too much attention to them. Let them seek our
acquaintance, not we theirs. The advantage will be on our side then.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this suggestion of the Guardian, the girls turned their attention
again to the conditions about their bathing beach. A moment later
Katherine made a discovery that centered all interest in unaffected
earnest upon the latest depredation of their enemy, or enemies. With a
stick she fished out one end of a small rope and was soon hauling away
at what appeared to be the &#8220;clothes line&#8221; they had used to indicate the
safety limits of their bathing place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, conditions are not as bad as they might be,&#8221; said Miss Ladd, as
she took hold to assist at hauling the line out of the water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span> &#8220;We have
the stakes and the rope and can put them back into place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you mind telling us what has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>These words drew the attention of the Camp Fire Girls away from the
object discovered in the water and to the speaker, who was one of the
older of the urbanely clad summer resorters from the Graham cottage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone has been guilty of some very malicious mischief,&#8221; Miss Ladd
replied. &#8220;We had roped in a bathing place after examining it and finding
it safe for those who are not good swimmers, and you see what has been
done with our work. The stakes were pulled up and the rope hidden in the
water. Fortunately we have just discovered the rope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that mean!&#8221; said the younger girl, whom the campers surmised
correctly to be Olga Graham.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mean is no name for it,&#8221; the other Graham girl declared vengefully.
&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you any idea who did it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None that is very tangible,&#8221; Miss Ladd replied. &#8220;There was a mysterious
prowler near our camp last evening, but we didn&#8217;t catch sight of him. He
threw a heavy stone into our bonfire and knocked the sparks and embers
in every direction, but he kept himself hidden. A little later we heard
a hideous call in the timbers, which we were pretty sure was intended to
frighten us.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s strange,&#8221; commented the older of the visitors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s the ghost,&#8221; suggested Olga with a faint smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ghost!&#8221; repeated several of the Camp Fire Girls in unison.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just joking,&#8221; the younger Graham girl explained hurriedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you suggest a ghost even as a joke?&#8221; inquired Katherine. The
utterance of the word ghost, together with the probability that there
was a neighborhood story behind it, forced upon her imagination an
irrational explanation of the strange occurrences of the last evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t mean anything by it,&#8221; Olga reassured, but her words seemed
to come with a slightly forced unnaturalness. &#8220;But there has been some
talk about a ghost around here, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did anybody ever see it?&#8221; asked Hazel Edwards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that I know of,&#8221; avowed Olga. &#8220;Of course, I don&#8217;t believe in such
things, but, then, you never can tell. It might be a half-witted person,
and I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know which I&#8217;d rather meet after dark&mdash;a ghost or a
crazy man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there a crazy man running loose around here?&#8221; Ernestine Johanson
inquired with a shudder.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be,&#8221; Olga declared with a suggestion of awe in her voice.
&#8220;If it isn&#8217;t a ghost&mdash;and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span> don&#8217;t believe in such things&mdash;it must be
somebody escaped from a lunatic asylum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw something mysterious moving through the woods near our cottage
one night,&#8221; Addie Graham interposed at this point. &#8220;Nobody else in the
family would believe me when I told them about it. It looked like a man
in a long white robe and long hair and a long white beard. It was
moonlight and I was looking out of my bedroom window. Suddenly this
strange being appeared near the edge of the timber. He was looking
toward the house, and I suppose he saw me, for he picked up a stone and
threw it at the window where I stood. It fell a few feet short of its
mark, and then the ghost or the insane man&mdash;call him what you
please&mdash;turned and ran away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My sister told us about that next morning, and we all laughed at her,&#8221;
said Olga, continuing the account. &#8220;I told her to go out and find the
stone, and she went out and picked one up just about where she said the
stone that was thrown at her fell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were there any other stones near there?&#8221; Marion Stanlock inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;We looked around specially to find out if there were any others near,
but didn&#8217;t find any,&#8221; Olga answered. &#8220;Addie&mdash;that&#8217;s my sister&mdash;had the
laugh on us all after that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you live in the cottage over there?&#8221; Ethel Zimmerman inquired,
pointing toward Graham summer residence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Addie replied. &#8220;Our name is Graham.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span> We were very much interested
when we learned that a company of Camp Fire Girls were camping near us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you girls camp out any?&#8221; Katherine asked with the view of
possibly bringing out an explanation of the Graham girls&#8217; attire, which
seemed suited more for promenading along a metropolitan boulevard than
for any other purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear no,&#8221; Olga answered somewhat deprecatingly. &#8220;We&#8217;d like to well
enough, you know, but we&#8217;re in society so much that we just don&#8217;t have
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Katherine wanted to ask the Graham girls if they were going to a stylish
reception before breakfast, but restrained the impulse.</p>

<p>Both Katherine and Hazel recognized Addie as the girl whom, on their
first trip to Stony Point, they had seen handle roughly the little boy
they believed to be Glen Irving, the grandnephew of Mrs. Hutchins&#8217; late
husband in whose interests they made the present trip of inspection.
Whether or not she recognized among the campers the two girls to whom
she had behaved so rudely on that occasion did not appear from her
manner, which was all sweetness now. She continued her social discourse
thus:</p>

<p>&#8220;I really wish society did not demand so much of our time, and I&#8217;m sure
my sister feels the same way about it. There&#8217;s nothing we&#8217;d like better
than to become Camp Fire Girls and live close to nature, you know, just
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span> way you girls live. Truly it must be delightful. But when you
become an integral figure in society (she really said integral), you are
regarded as indispensable, and society won&#8217;t let go of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>None of the Camp Fire Girls attempted to reply to this speech. Their
plan was to bring about an appearance of friendship between them and the
Grahams in order that they might associate with the family that had
custody of the little boy in whose interests they were working. Any
attempt on their part, they felt, to discuss &#8220;society&#8221; from the point of
view of the Graham girls must result in a betrayal of their utter lack
of sympathy with this &#8220;social indispensability&#8221; of such helpless society
victims.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d like, however, to do something for you in your unfortunate
situation,&#8221; Addie Graham continued with a gush of seeming friendliness.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sure my brother James&mdash;he&#8217;s 16 years old&mdash;would be glad to assist
you in any way he can. I&#8217;m going to send him down here, if you say the
word, to help you extend that rope around your swimming place. He&#8217;s a
very handy boy, and it would be much better for you to let him do the
work than to perform such a laborious task yourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you ever so much,&#8221; returned Miss Ladd with a warmth that seemed
to indicate acceptance of the offer. The truth was that anything which
tended to increase friendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span> relations between them and the Grahams was
acceptable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send him around today,&#8221; the older Graham girl promised. &#8220;We must
hurry back now for breakfast. We were just out for an early morning
constitutional, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and see us any time you wish,&#8221; Miss Ladd urged. &#8220;You&#8217;ll always be
welcome. We haven&#8217;t made the acquaintance of anybody around here yet.
Come over and help us eat one of our constitutional luncheons, or
suppers. We have real picnics every day, the jolliest kind of
times&mdash;except when the ghost walks. Maybe you can help us catch the
ghost, also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we can,&#8221; said Addie. &#8220;Well, good-by. You girls come and see us,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; was the acknowledgment uttered by several of the members of
Flamingo Camp Fire as the two Misses Graham stepped primly in their
French-heel shoes over the uneven ground and returned homeward along a
diagonal course up the side of the hill-shore of Twin One.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2><h3>&#8220;HIGH C.&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>All the members of Flamingo Camp Fire gathered close together on the
sandy beach after the departure of the two Graham girls and held a
low-toned discussion of the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was only one thing missing this morning,&#8221; Hazel Edwards observed.
&#8220;That was the perfume. I suppose they didn&#8217;t have time to spill it on in
proper proportions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder why they came down here at this time of day?&#8221; said Harriet
Newcomb. &#8220;There must be something in the air.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet they never got up this early before unless their house was
afire,&#8221; Ethel Zimmerman ventured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose they wanted to be on hand to witness our discomfiture
when we discovered what had been done to our swimming place?&#8221; Azalia
Atwood asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would imply that they knew who did it and may even have been a
party to the plot,&#8221; Miss Ladd reasoned.</p>

<p>&#8220;And why not?&#8221; Azalia returned. &#8220;They don&#8217;t look to me, for a moment, to
be above it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel like a miserable hypocrite,&#8221; Katherine declared with a sarcastic
smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m not used to extending warm expressions of friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span> to
people for whom I haven&#8217;t any use and asking them to call and see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember you&#8217;re a spy now,&#8221; said Helen Nash slyly. &#8220;When engaged in a
praiseworthy spy work, always remember your mother and the pantry and
the fist in the jam, if you have any doubt as to the worthiness of your
occupation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough said,&#8221; Katherine announced, &#8220;I&#8217;m convinced. The jam is well
spiced and I smell it already. I shall expect to find it on somebody&#8217;s
fist.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls did not forego their morning plunge because of the removal of
the &#8220;safety line,&#8221; but were careful to keep well within the approximate
limit which they remembered fairly well. After about fifteen minutes in
the water they returned to the camp and donned their khaki middies; then
they had breakfast.</p>

<p>The breakfast dishes had not long been washed and put away when another
caller arrived at the camp. Although not unheralded, the appearance of
this new arrival was a surprise to all the girls, for they had not
rested much importance upon the promise of Addie Graham to send her
brother to them to offer his assistance in repairing the damage done by
some mischief-maker in the night before.</p>

<p>The young male scion of the Graham family appeared so suddenly before
the eyes of the girl campers that some of them afterward expressed the
suspicion that he walked timidly on his tiptoes all the way from his
home to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span> camp. Indeed all the members of Flamingo Fire have today a
decided impression that the sound of his voice was the first notice they
had of his approach.</p>

<p>Whether this impression be a true one or not, that voice was enough to
compel memory of it ahead of anything else. It was the most effeminately
high-pitched voice the girls had ever heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, young ladies, but my name is James Graham, Jr.,&#8221; squeaked
the treble clef.</p>

<p>There was a general start throughout the camp. Most of the girls were
seated upon the grassy plot within the crescent arrangement of the tents
and engaged in their forenoon routine, and several of them actually
dropped their craft work into their laps so great was their surprise.
Ethel Zimmerman uttered a little cry of astonishment in almost the same
key as the announcement of the newcomer.</p>

<p>The latter was almost as effeminate in appearance as in voice. First, he
was very much overgrown and fleshy. He probably weighed 150 pounds. His
face was round and very pale, and his eyes were not over-endowed with
expression. He wore a &#8220;peaches-and-cream&#8221; two-piece suit and a panama
fedora and carried a delicate bamboo cane.</p>

<p>&#8220;My two thoughtful sisters info&#8217;med me that you young ladies were in
need of the assistance of a man, and I volunteered to offer my aid,&#8221;
continued young Master Graham.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear me,&#8221; replied Katherine; &#8220;it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span> be a shame to put you to so
much trouble. We thank you ever so much for your offer, but we&#8217;d much
rather retain the friendship of your folks by urging you not to insist.
If you really must be so good as you suggest, you might go back and send
your hostler or chauffeur, but tell him to bring a pair of rubber boots
that reach to his ears.&#8221;</p>

<p>This rather enigmatical answer puzzled the not very quick-witted James,
Jr., and his chin dropped.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, we want a pile-driver out in the lake to sink some posts into
the submarine earth,&#8221; Katherine continued. &#8220;But, by the way, come to
think of it, you might help us wonderfully if you have a rowboat and
would lend it to us for an hour or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure I&#8217;ve got a boat,&#8221; replied the &#8220;would-(not)-be ladies&#8217; aid,&#8221; as one
of the girls afterward dubbed him. The tone of relief with which he now
spoke was unmistakable. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go and row it right over to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t want it until about 11 o&#8217;clock,&#8221; said Miss Ladd. &#8220;If you need
it between now and then you&#8217;d better wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh we won&#8217;t want it all day,&#8221; James, Jr., returned reassuringly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
bring it right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope he doesn&#8217;t tip his boat over on his &#8216;high C&#8217;,&#8221; Hazel Edwards
said generously, as the caller disappeared in the timber. &#8220;He might be
drowned in the billows of his own voice.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s his name&mdash;High C,&#8221; declared Estelle Adler enthusiastically. &#8220;I
refuse to recognize him by any other name. Dear me, girls, did you ever
in all your born days hear such a voice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; cried several in chorus.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s just the dearest thing I ever saw,&#8221; declared Ernestine Johanson,
making a face as sour as the reputation of a crabapple.</p>

<p>At this moment the discussion of &#8220;High C&#8221; was dropped as suddenly as
&#8220;it&#8221; had appeared upon the scene. Another arrival claimed the interest
of the girls.</p>

<p>It was a little boy about ten years old, clad in steel-gray Palm Beach
knickerbockers and golf cap, but not at all happy in appearance. He was
a good looking youth, but there was no sprightly cheerfulness in his
countenance. He seemed nervous and on the alert.</p>

<p>&#8220;My goodness!&#8221; exclaimed Hazel Edwards; &#8220;that&#8217;s Glen Irving, the little
boy we&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Katherine, who was seated close to Hazel, cut the latter&#8217;s utterance
short by clapping her hand over the speaker&#8217;s mouth.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2><h3>THE RUNAWAY.</h3>
</div>

<p>The boy was excited. Evidently he was laboring under anything but normal
conditions. He had appeared very suddenly around the north end of the
bluff which sheltered the camp on the east. &#8220;High C&#8221; or &#8220;Jimmie Junior,&#8221;
as the girls from now on referred to young Graham, had left the camp
around the south extremity of the bluff.</p>

<p>The youth in Palm Beach knickerbockers fairly rushed from the thicket
north of the camp and directly toward the girls, all of whom jumped to
their feet in astonishment. The newcomer did not slacken his pace, but
ran up to the group of startled campers as if seeking their protection
from a &#8220;Bogy Man.&#8221; And as he stopped in the midst of the group which
circled around him almost as excited as he, the little fellow looked
back as if expecting to behold some frightful looking object bearing
down upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ran away,&#8221; were his first words; &#8220;so&mdash;so they couldn&#8217;t beat me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who wanted to beat you?&#8221; inquired Miss Ladd sympathetically, leaning
over and taking him gently by the hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mom&mdash;an&#8217; Ad.&mdash;an&#8217; Olg.&mdash;an&#8217; Jim&mdash;they all hit me,&#8221; he replied, his eyes
flashing with anger. &#8220;Mom locked me in a room, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span> opened a window
an&#8217; clum out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they beat you today?&#8221; Hazel Edwards questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the youth with a puzzled look; &#8220;they don&#8217;t want you to
know they whipped me. They stopped it after you came and after a man
came and told &#8217;em not to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is the man?&#8221; Hazel asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I heard his name, but I forgot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it Langford?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s it&mdash;Langford. He told &#8217;em all to be good as pie to me while
you was here. They thought I was asleep, but I was just pretendin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Mr. Langford say why they must be good to you while we were here?&#8221;
asked Katherine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he did,&#8221; the boy replied slowly. &#8220;He said somebody&#8217;d take me
away and Mom &#8217;u&#8217;d lose a lot o&#8217; money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what we thought,&#8221; Hazel declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;What else did you overhear?&#8221; Katherine inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re goin&#8217; to be awful nice and awful mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Awful nice and awful mean,&#8221; Katherine repeated. &#8220;That&#8217;s interesting.
What do you mean by that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re goin&#8217; to be awful nice to your face, but mean on the sly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have they done anything mean yet?&#8221; Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span> Ladd interposed, having in
mind the depredations of the night before.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; the boy answered. &#8220;They were talkin&#8217; about doing
somethin&#8217; last night, and the man and Jim went out together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what they proposed to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;just somethin&#8217;, anything they could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name, little boy?&#8221; Hazel asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glen&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glen what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glen Graham.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it Glen Irving?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy looked doubtfully at his interrogator.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he replied slowly. &#8220;I guess not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you ever hear the name Irving before?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s face brightened up suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was my papa&#8217;s name,&#8221; he said eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I want to ask you an important question,&#8221; said Miss Ladd
impressively. &#8220;Try your best to tell us all you can, and don&#8217;t tell any
of the Grahams you were down here talking to us. We won&#8217;t forget you. If
they beat you any more come, and tell us if you can get away. We&#8217;ll have
the police after them. But be sure to keep this to yourself. Now, here&#8217;s
the question I want you to answer: Did anybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span> outside of the Graham
family ever see them beat you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; Glen replied quickly. &#8220;Byron Scott did. So did Mrs. Pruitt and
Guy Davis and Mark Taylor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do they live?&#8221; was Miss Ladd&#8217;s next question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Byron lives here, so does Mrs. Pruitt. Guy and Mark live in Baltimore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do they live near the Graham&#8217;s home in Baltimore?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, right in the same block. Mark lives next door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. Now, Glen, we are going to take you back to Mrs. Graham. We
haven&#8217;t any right to keep you here, but if they beat you any more, we
will complain to the police and take you away never to come back to
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wish you would,&#8221; exclaimed the little fellow, throwing his arms
around the neck of the Guardian who had seated herself on the grass
before him. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want them to scare you with a ghost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scare us with a ghost!&#8221; Miss Ladd repeated in astonishment. &#8220;What do
you mean by that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They said&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; the boy began, but his explanation was interrupted in a
manner so confusing that the group of Camp Fire Girls might easily have
wondered if the world were suddenly assuming all the absurdities of a
clownish paradise in order to be consistent with what was now taking
place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p>Addie Graham, the girl of ultra-style and perfume who had behaved so
rudely to little Glen when she discovered the runaway with Katherine and
Hazel in the woods, suddenly dashed into the deeply interested group of
Camp Fire inquisitors, seized the boy in her arms, kissed him with
apparent passionate fondness, and addressed him with a gush of
endearment that must have brought tears to the eyes of an
unsophisticated listener.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2><h3>A LITTLE SCRAPPER.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you dear little brother, you dear darling child,&#8221; almost sobbed
Addie as she seized Glen Irving in her arms and began to shower kisses
on his unwilling face.</p>

<p>The boy shrunk away, or into as small a compass as he was able, to
escape from the &#8220;affectionate attack.&#8221; Plainly it was anything but
pleasing to him.</p>

<p>The &#8220;attack,&#8221; however, did not cease in response to his protest. Addie
held onto her captive with all her strength, at the same time attempting
to soothe his wrath or fear, or both, with as many kisses as she could
force in between the boy&#8217;s belligerent arms. Glen, conscious of the
presence of friends who, he believed, would go to any extreme to assist
him, fought as he had never fought before, desperately, viciously. He
used his fists and fingernails to good purpose and pulled Addie&#8217;s hair
until it presented a ludicrous appearance of disarrangement.</p>

<p>Realizing that the boy&#8217;s actions might prove harmful to his cause if
this affair should ever be contested in the courts, Miss Ladd decided to
take a hand and do what she could to pacify the young heir who had
suddenly been transformed into a veritable wildcat. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span> had no doubt
that there was good cause in his past experience for the development of
such character in him, but expediency demanded that it be checked at
once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, let me take him,&#8221; Miss Ladd urged as she laid her hands on his
shoulders and attempted to draw him away. A few gentle words and an
exhibition of a kind persuasiveness of manner brought success. She drew
the lad back some distance and tried to reason with him, whereupon he
burst into convulsive sobbing.</p>

<p>His sobs were not a new expression of an outburst of passion. Miss Ladd
was certain of this. Little Glen was weeping not because anger &#8220;opened
the floodgates of his soul,&#8221; but because of some picture of dread in his
past experience which he feared would be repeated in the future.</p>

<p>But Addie Graham was not equal to the occasion. The veneer of gentleness
that she had put on could not withstand the deep-seated spitefulness of
her nature, and as she observed a severe scratch on one hand and felt
the disarrangement of her hair, she yielded impulsively to vengefulness
of spirit that was boiling within her and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;The miserable little pest! Just wait till I get you home, Glen Graham,
and I&#8217;ll&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped right there, much to the disappointment of the eagerly
listening Camp Fire Girls, who fully expected her to open an avenue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span> to
the very evidence for which they were looking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; she continued, with a desperate effort to control her temper. &#8220;I
never knew him to act that way before. He&#8217;s usually such a&mdash;such
a&mdash;sweet dispositioned little dear. I don&#8217;t know what to make of it. He
took me completely by surprise. I don&#8217;t understand it&mdash;I don&#8217;t know what
to make of it&mdash;I can&#8217;t understand the little&mdash;the little&mdash;d-dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is strange, very strange,&#8221; Miss Ladd agreed, purposing, for policy&#8217;s
sake, to help the girl out of her predicament.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to sister, Glennie dear,&#8221; Addie continued, after she had succeeded
in rearranging her hair and restoring her hat to its normal position on
her head. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know sister loves you just lots? Why did you run
away? Come back home and sister will give you some candy, just lots of
it. Come on, now, that&#8217;s a good little boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want your candy and you ain&#8217;t my sister, and I won&#8217;t go back.
You&#8217;ll beat me, and mom&#8217;ll beat me and everybody else&#8217;ll beat me. Don&#8217;t
let her take me back, please don&#8217;t,&#8221; Glen concluded, turning his face
pleadingly toward Miss Ladd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you must go back, Glen,&#8221; the Guardian replied, reproachfully.
&#8220;That&#8217;s your home, don&#8217;t you know? Where in the world will you go if you
don&#8217;t go back home? Think of it&mdash;no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span> place in the world to go, no place
in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a tone of awe in the young woman&#8217;s voice that impressed the
boy. He cooled down considerably and looked meditatively at his monitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll beat me,&#8221; he protested earnestly. &#8220;They&#8217;ll tie me to a bed post
and strap me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how perfectly terrible!&#8221; Addie exclaimed. &#8220;I never heard of such a
thing. I can&#8217;t understand such remarks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what we&#8217;ll do,&#8221; Katherine suggested reassuringly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
all go back to the house with you and fix everything up nice. They won&#8217;t
beat you, I&#8217;m sure. Come on, Miss Graham, we&#8217;ll help you, if you don&#8217;t
think we&#8217;re intruding.&#8221;</p>

<p>Addie did not know how to reply and did not attempt to. She started
toward home and the Camp Fire Girls followed her, Miss Ladd leading the
battling runaway by the hand.</p>

<p>Glen was considerably bewildered and apparently submissive during the
journey homeward. He said little, and when he spoke, it was only a short
reply to something said to him.</p>

<p>At the door of the cottage, they were met by Mrs. Graham, to whom Addie
introduced them. None of the girls were well impressed by the woman&#8217;s
appearance or manner. She affected the same ungenuine interest and
affection for Glen that had characterized Addie&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span> manner toward him.
But they managed to bring about a condition more or less reassuring to
the boy and left him, with secret misgivings, in the custody of the
family which they held more than ever under suspicion.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to do some real spy work now,&#8221; said Miss Ladd after they had
reached their camp again. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to find out what is going on in
that house when those people have no suspicion that they are being
watched.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2><h3>AMMUNITION AND CATAPULTS.</h3>
</div>

<p>The thirteen Camp Fire Girls and their Guardian are hardly to be
censured because they did little more work of a routine nature that day.
One could hardly expect them to fix their minds upon any &#8220;even tenor&#8221;
occupation while the thrills of recent developments supplied so much
stimulus for discussion of future prospect.</p>

<p>They were careful in these discussions not to leave open any possibility
of their being overheard. Their conversations were always held in low
tones and in places where it would be difficult for any of the members
of the Graham family to find positions of concealment near enough to
overhear what was being said.</p>

<p>One thing decided upon was in line with Miss Ladd&#8217;s declaration that
they must find out &#8220;what was going on in the Graham house,&#8221; having
reference, of course, to the treatment received there by little Glen in
view of his violent protest against being returned to the care and
custody of the people whom he charged with acts of cruelty toward
himself. A scouting expedition was planned for the evening, the
&#8220;official scouts&#8221; of the Fire&mdash;Katherine and Hazel&mdash;being delegated to
this work. Katherine proposed that two others be selected to assist
them, and Miss Ladd suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span> that they choose their assistants
themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll think it over and pick them before suppertime,&#8221; said Katherine
after conferring with Hazel.</p>

<p>The result was that before sundown Azalia Atwood and Ernestine Johanson
had been added to the spy squad. Their selection came as a result of
general discussions of the work in prospect, in the course of which both
Azalia and Ernestine made several suggestions that were regarded as
clever and helpful for the scouting plans.</p>

<p>Shortly after the girls returned from the Graham cottage to their camp,
&#8220;Jimmie Junior&#8221; of the &#8220;treble cleff voice&#8221; appeared with the
announcement that he had brought his boat to the Camp Fire landing and
moored it by tying the painter to a projecting rock. They thanked him
and proceeded at once with the task of restoring the safety-guard line
to their bathing place. All put on their bathing suits and went down to
the beach.</p>

<p>With the aid of the boat their work was much easier than it had been the
first time. It is no easy performance for one person to sit on the
shoulders of another and wield a mallet on the upper end of a stake held
by a third person in water arm-pit deep. If you doubt this assertion,
just try it.</p>

<p>Well, this difficult feat was unnecessary this time. The stakes, rope,
and mallet were put into the boat, and three of the girls got in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span> and
rowed out to the point where the southwest stake had been driven before.
Then two of them plunged overboard and, while one of these steadied the
boat and the other held the stake in position, the girl in the boat
drove it firmly into the sand-clay bed of the lake.</p>

<p>This operation was repeated until the supports of the buoy-line were all
restored. Then the rope was stretched from stake to stake and wooden
buoys attached as before.</p>

<p>The work was speedily performed and then the girls all had a good swim.
When they returned to their camp, it was lunch time and the &#8220;gastronomic
committee,&#8221; as Harriet, the &#8220;walking dictionary,&#8221; had dubbed the
commissary department, got busy. During the meal, which they ate on a
&#8220;newspaper tablecloth,&#8221; picnic-style, the subject of organized
self-protection against further depredations was discussed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe we ought to establish a relief watch system to be kept up all
night every night as long as there seems to be any danger of our being
molested by prowlers like those who paid us a visit last night,&#8221; Estelle
announced.</p>

<p>&#8220;What would we do if we caught anybody at any mischief?&#8221; asked Azalia.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d sail right into &#8217;em and give &#8217;em Hail Columbia,&#8221; declared Hazel
like a vigilance committee chairman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;d pull their hair,&#8221; said Marie Crismore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;And scratch their eyes out,&#8221; Ernestine chimed in.</p>

<p>&#8220;And boo-shoo &#8217;em away,&#8221; added Julietta Hyde.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m positively ashamed of you for talking that way,&#8221; Miss Ladd
interposed. &#8220;You&#8217;re laughing at yourselves because you are girls. Now,
you ought not to do that, even in fun. How many of you can do some real
boys&#8217; stunts just as well as the boys can?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can swim half a mile,&#8221; announced Hazel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can do a fly-away from the horizontal bar,&#8221; declared Violet Munday.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can run a hundred-yard dash in thirteen seconds,&#8221; said Ernestine;
&#8220;and that&#8217;s better than lots of boys can do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can throw a ball like a boy,&#8221; said Helen Nash.</p>

<p>&#8220;So can I&#8221;&mdash;this from Marion Stanlock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, several of us can do that,&#8221; Katherine declared. &#8220;We&#8217;ve played ball
with the boys. But now you&#8217;re getting close to what I was driving at.
We&#8217;ll proceed to gather a supply of ammunition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ammunition!&#8221; several exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; Katherine replied. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get it down on the beach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I get you,&#8221; said Estelle. &#8220;You mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rocks,&#8221; cried Marie, getting the word in ahead of Estelle.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; Katherine admitted. &#8220;We&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span> shower rocks at anybody that
makes us any more trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very ingenious,&#8221; Miss Ladd said approvingly. &#8220;If those persons who
visited us last night come again, they&#8217;ll get a warm reception.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a hard one,&#8221; Marion supplemented.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have another idea,&#8221; Helen announced, and everybody turned attention
to her. &#8220;I have some heavy rubber bands in my grip. I always carry them
because they come in very handy sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can you do with them?&#8221; Estelle asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think?&#8221; Helen returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; cried Ethel Zimmerman. &#8220;Make catapults with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; several of the girls exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The boys call them slingshots,&#8221; said the Guardian.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you make a slingshot?&#8221; Julietta inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Marion announced. &#8220;You cut a forked stick, like the letter
&#8216;Y.&#8217; Then you tie two rubber bands to it, one to each fork. Between the
other ends of the bands you tie a little sack, or shallow pocket, made
of leather or strong cloth. You put a stone in this pocket and pull it
back, stretching the rubber bands, take aim, and let it fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have had experience making those things,&#8221; Katherine suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I never made one,&#8221; Marion replied: &#8220;but I&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span> watched my cousin
make them and shoot them, too. He was very skillful at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you shoot a catapult?&#8221; Katherine inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can,&#8221; Marion answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Katherine. &#8220;We&#8217;ll make several, and those who can&#8217;t throw
stones can use slingshots.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was a very busy afternoon for this warlike group of girls. While
the luncheon dishes were being washed and put away, Katherine and Hazel
rowed the boat back to the Graham landing, thanked &#8220;Jimmie Junior&#8221; for
its use, accepted with solemn countenances his &#8220;high-C&#8221; &#8220;You&#8217;re
welcome,&#8221; and returned to their camp. Then the work of manufacturing
arms and ammunition, in anticipation of another midnight invasion,
began.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2><h3>THE GHOST.</h3>
</div>

<p>Before the &#8220;preparedness program&#8221; of the afternoon was started, Miss
Ladd addressed the group of Camp Fire Girls thus, speaking in low tone,
of course, in order that she might not be overheard by any eavesdropper
who might be in hiding in the vicinity:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, we want to do this thing right. How many of you feel that you can
throw a stone a considerable distance and accurately?&#8221;</p>

<p>Katherine, Helen, Marion and Violet held up their hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many of you would like to use catapults?&#8221; was the Guardian&#8217;s next
question.</p>

<p>The hands of Harriet, Marie, Ethel, and Ruth went up promptly. A moment
later Estelle and Ernestine also put up theirs.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I could learn how,&#8221; said Estelle.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want too much demonstration around here this afternoon,&#8221; Miss
Ladd warned. &#8220;Everything must proceed quietly and as if nothing unusual
were taking place. How many rubber bands have you, Helen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, a dozen or twenty,&#8221; the latter replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll proceed to cut half a dozen Y-forks and make them into
catapults. We&#8217;ll start out at once. Hazel, you get a hatchet, and,
Marie, you get a saw; the rest of you get your combination knives.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>In a few minutes they were in the thick of the timber, searching the
small trees and saplings for Y-forks to serve as catapult handles. In
half an hour they returned with a dozen of varying degree of symmetry
and excellence.</p>

<p>Then the work of assembling the parts of these miniature engines of war
began. Some of the girls exhibited a good deal of mechanical skill,
while others made moves and suggestions so awkward as to occasion much
laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, anyway,&#8221; said Marie after she had been merrily criticised for
sewing up the &#8220;mouth&#8221; of a &#8220;pocket&#8221; so narrowly that a stone could
hardly fly out of it; &#8220;there are lots of boys who would make a worse job
sewing on a button. Don&#8217;t you remember last winter at a button-sewing
contest, Paul Wetzler cast the thread over and over and over the side of
the button&mdash;and he didn&#8217;t know any better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a very convenient way to dodge a joke on you, Marie,&#8221; said
Violet. &#8220;But just because boys don&#8217;t know anything is no reason why we
shouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew! some slam at me,&#8221; Marie exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;m very properly squelched.&#8221;</p>

<p>After half a dozen catapults had been made, the girls practiced slinging
stones for an hour and several of them developed considerable skill. In
this way it was determined who should have the preference in the use of
these weapons.</p>

<p>Then at the suggestion of Miss Ladd, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span> dozen slings were made to be
tied about the waist for carrying a supply of stones, some the size of
an egg, for throwing with the hand and pebbles for use in the catapults.
After these were completed, the girls went down to the beach and
gathered a plentiful supply and took them back to the camp. Then a score
or two of these stones were deposited in the slings, and the latter were
put in convenient places in the tents on short notice. The catapults
also were turned over to those of the girls who proved most capable of
using them skillfully.</p>

<p>The last item of preparations on the program of the day consisted of
completing plans for a succession of night watch reliefs. As Katherine,
Hazel, Azalia, and Ernestine were assigned to special scout duty
immediately after dusk, they were excused from assignment on any of the
reliefs. This left ten girls among whom the watches might be divided,
which was done in the following manner:</p>

<p>The eight sleeping hours from 9 P. M. to 5 A. M. were divided into five
watches of equal length and assignments were made thus:</p>

<p>First watch: Marion Stanlock and Helen Nash. Second watch: Ruth Hazelton
and Ethel Zimmerman. Third watch: Violet Munday and Harriet Newcomb.
Fourth watch: Julietta Hyde and Marie Crismore. Fifth watch: Estelle
Adler and the Guardian, Miss Ladd.</p>

<p>Nothing further of particular interest took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span> place during the rest of
the day, except that shortly before suppertime Addie and Olga Graham,
both dressed &#8220;fit to kill,&#8221; called at the camp and thanked the girls for
their assistance in getting &#8220;their brother&#8221; back home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he all right now?&#8221; Hazel inquired with genuine concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s fine,&#8221; Addie replied. &#8220;You see he has spells of that kind
every now and then, and we don&#8217;t know what to make of it. But today&#8217;s
was the worst spell he ever had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you do anything for him?&#8221; Hazel asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can we do?&#8221; Addie returned. &#8220;He isn&#8217;t sick. I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s just a
little distemper. There is absolutely no reason for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Ladd asked the Graham girls to remain at the camp for supper, but
they &#8220;begged to be excused on account of a pressing social engagement.&#8221;</p>

<p>After darkness had fallen as heavily as could be expected on a clear,
though moonless night, the four scouts set out through the timber toward
the Graham cottage. All of them carried flashlights and clubs which
might easily have been mistaken in the dark for mere walking sticks. The
clubs were for protection against dogs or any other living being which
might exhibit hostility toward them. Katherine and Hazel had also two of
the rubber-band catapults, as they had exhibited no little skill, for
novices, in the use of them.</p>

<p>The other girls built a small fire near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span> tents, to keep the
mosquitos away, and sat around it chatting and waited for the scouts to
return. Miss Ladd insisted, as soon as dusk began to gather, that they
bring out their &#8220;ammunition&#8221; from the tents and keep it close at hand
for immediate use if anything should happen to require it.</p>

<p>And something did happen, something of quite unexpected and startling
character. The scouts had been gone about half an hour and the night had
settled down to a blanket of darkness on the earth, a sprinkle of
starlight in the sky, the croaking of frogs, the songs of katydids and
the occasional ripple of water on the lake shore. A poet might have
breathed a sigh of delightful awe. Well, the girls were pleasureably
impressed with scene and the sounds, if they were not exactly delighted,
and the awe was coming.</p>

<p>It came without warning and was before them very suddenly. It was in the
form of a man in a long, white robe, long white hair and whiskers, the
latter reaching almost to his waist. He stalked, stiffly, unemotionally
out of the darkness south of the camp and across the open space within
thirty feet of the fire, where sat the startled, chill-thrilled group of
girls, speechless with something akin to fear and momentarily powerless
to shake off the spell that held them as rigid as statues.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2><h3>A BUMP ON THE HEAD.</h3>
</div>

<p>Suddenly Helen Nash&#8217;s memory served her so well that she regained
control of her wits with a shock. Here is what she remembered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want them to scare you with a ghost&#8221;&mdash;these words uttered by
little Glen just before his warning speech was interrupted by the
appearance of Addie Graham at the girls&#8217; camp.</p>

<p>That recollection was enough for Helen. There was nothing tenuous,
elusively subtle, or impenetrably mysterious any longer about the
ghostly apparition. Little Glen had something very clear and definite in
his mind when he made that remark.</p>

<p>Her muscles having relaxed from their rigid strain of superstitious
suspense, Helen reached for the &#8220;ammunition sling&#8221; that she had placed
beside her and drew therefrom one of the catapults they had made in the
afternoon, also a pebble about the size of a marble, and fitted the
latter in the pocket of the weapon. Then she drew back the pocket and
the pebble, stretching the rubber bands as far as she could extend them,
and took careful aim.</p>

<p>Helen had practiced with this weapon a good deal in the last two or
three hours and acquired considerable proficiency for so short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span> a period
of experience. Moreover, she was skilled in amateur archery and could
pull a bow with a strong right arm. This experience, together with a
general systematic athletic training at school, rendered her
particularly well adapted for her present undertaking.</p>

<p>The other girls, under the spell of awe-fascination which had seized and
held Helen before it was broken by a sudden jog of her memory, knew
nothing of what was going on in their midst until they heard the snap of
the rubber bands. And doubtless it would have taken them considerable
time to fathom it had the pebble-shooter&#8217;s aim not proved to be
remarkably good. It struck the &#8220;ghost&#8221; on the head.</p>

<p>Of course even Helen could not follow the pebble through the air with
her eyes, nor could she see where it struck, but other unmistakable
evidence informed her as to the trueness of her aim and the effect of
the blow. A sharp thud informed her that she had hit something of
substantial resistance, and the next bit of evidence broke the spell for
the other girls with a realization of what had taken place.</p>

<p>The &#8220;ghost&#8221; wavered and seemed about to topple over, at the same time
emitting a groan of pain which proved him to be thoroughly human. Helen
was frightened, but there was a new kind of awe in this fright. All
suggestion of superstition had left her and in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span> place was the dread
that she might have killed a man.</p>

<p>The latter dread, however, was soon dispelled. The &#8220;ghost&#8221; did not fall.
He staggered, it is true&mdash;evidently the pain of the blow had stunned him
considerably; but he managed to put speed into his pace, although the
evidence of his suffering was even greater after he began to run. In a
minute he disappeared in the darkness of the timber.</p>

<p>&#8220;My! that was a good shot, Helen,&#8221; Ethel Zimmerman exclaimed. &#8220;And he
will surely wear some lump on his head for some time to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid I pulled too hard,&#8221; Helen replied with a sigh of relief;
&#8220;and, believe me, I&#8217;d rather be scared by a ghost several times over
than with the prospect of having a murder record.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is he?&mdash;have you any idea?&#8221; Violet asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you guess?&#8221; Helen answered. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he someone connected with the
Graham family?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was he trying to do&mdash;scare us?&#8221; Julietta inquired, addressing the
question as much to herself as to anybody else.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should imagine something of the kind, although he may be the crazy
man the Graham girls spoke about,&#8221; said Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe there is any such person,&#8221; Miss Ladd volunteered at
this point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Then why did they suggest such an idea?&#8221; Violet questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, unless it was to frighten us,&#8221; the Guardian replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Frighten us away from here,&#8221; Harriet supplemented.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said Helen. &#8220;That&#8217;s my theory of the affair. Don&#8217;t you
remember what Glen Irving said just before Addie Graham put in her
appearance and cut short our interview with the boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said something about ghosts,&#8221; Harriet recalled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not about ghosts, but <i>a</i> ghost,&#8221; Helen corrected. &#8220;It made quite an
impression on me. Didn&#8217;t any of you wonder what he meant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; announced Violet; &#8220;and I remember exactly what he said. It was
this: &#8216;I don&#8217;t want them to scare you with a ghost.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those were the very words,&#8221; Helen declared. &#8220;Now do you get the
connection between that remark and what just took place? Glen had heard
them talking over their plans, isn&#8217;t it all very clear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At least it is very interesting,&#8221; commented Miss Ladd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since you have got so near a solution of this affair, perhaps you&#8217;ll go
a step farther and tell your interested audience who that ghost was,&#8221;
Ruth Hazelton suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I wouldn&#8217;t be so rash as that,&#8221; Helen responded; &#8220;but if I were
going to write to Mrs. Hutchins tonight, I would suggest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span> to her that,
if Mr. Pierce Langford should return to Fairberry in the next week or
two, she might have somebody examine his head for a bump.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A phrenological bump?&#8221; inquired Harriet, the &#8220;walking dictionary.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a general laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a phrenological bump,&#8221; Helen answered.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2><h3>A CRUEL WOMAN.</h3>
</div>

<p>Katherine, Hazel, Ernestine and Azalia found it no easy task to pick
their way through the dark timber more than half a mile to the Graham
cottage. Several times, finding themselves hopelessly entangled in a
thicket, or stumbling over disagreeably uneven ground, and fearful of
losing their way, they made use of their flash lights until able to
continue their journey satisfactorily.</p>

<p>But after they caught their first glimpse of the light in the Graham
cottage, they made no further use of the flash lights. Guided by the
illuminated windows and their memory of the surroundings, they made
their way over the intervening space until within a hundred feet of the
house, where they halted and looked and listened for about fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p>First, they wished to make sure that there was no dog on the place. They
were reasonably certain that the Grahams kept no watchdog, as several of
the girls had been careful to check up in this regard when passing near
or calling at the cottage. But as additional precaution, they made a
careful inspection from a safe distance on this scouting expedition
before venturing close to the house.</p>

<p>The night was clear and warm, but no moon was shining. There was a
stillness in the air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span> which alone might have been expected to cause a
dog to howl for very lonesomeness. Even while the four scouts were
waiting for evidence of a canine guard at the Graham place, far away in
the distance there came a mournful howl from a mournful hound in a
farmyard. The sound was repeated several times, and although there were
two or three echoing responses from as many neighboring sources, none
came from a kinship kennel of the Graham premises.</p>

<p>At last Katherine and Hazel decided that it was safe to advance nearer
to the house. Leaving Azalia and Ernestine at the edge of the timber to
watch for any condition or circumstance that might prove unfriendly to
their venture, the two leaders advanced across the clearing.</p>

<p>As they neared the building, a sound, which they had not heard before
reached their ears and drove from their minds all thought or fear of a
watchdog. The sound was like the plaintive cry of a child and seemed to
be muffled as if coming through two or three thick walls.</p>

<p>There were two windows on the side of the house nearest the advancing
girl scouts. Through the drawn shade of one of these came the rays of
incandescent bulbs which lighted the room. The other window was dark.</p>

<p>The advance of Katherine and Hazel was guided now by the seeming source
of the muffled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span> cry. As they started for the house, their initial
impulse was to direct their steps toward the lighted window. But as they
approached the building, almost unconsciously they veered gradually to
the right until they found themselves standing close to the unlighted
window at the rear.</p>

<p>Without a doubt the muffled sounds came from this part of the cottage. A
whispered conversation between the girls resulted in the following
procedure: Hazel stood guard at a distance of ten or fifteen feet while
Katherine stood close to the window, almost pressing her ear against the
glass in order the better to hear the sounds that interested them. For
two or three minutes the listener continued in this attitude; then she
went to where Hazel stood and the latter advanced to the window and did
likewise. She also tried the sash to see if it was locked, succeeding in
raising it slightly, so that the sounds within reached her ear more
distinctly.</p>

<p>Several minutes later both of these girls returned to the edge of the
clearing and rejoined their two companions stationed there. A low-voiced
consultation was held, at the close of which Hazel said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, all this means that we&#8217;ll have to return to the cottage and stay
there until we find out something more. Let&#8217;s see what we can discover
in the front of the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>She and Katherine accordingly went back and directed their inspection as
Hazel had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span> suggested. The shade trees did not cover the lower pane to
the full limit and they were able to look in and get a fairly good view
of the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham and &#8220;Jimmie Junior&#8221; apparently were the only members of the
family at home, if we may disregard as one of the family, little Glen,
who undoubtedly was the author of the muffled sobs. Mrs. Graham was
reading a fashion magazine and her son was playing solitaire at a card
table.</p>

<p>Almost the first view acquainted the girls with the fact that the woman
was much disconcerted over something, and it soon became evident that
the cause of this nervousness was the sound of weeping that reached her
through the closed door of an adjoining room. Presently she arose, with
a hard look on her face and determined manner, and moved in the
direction from which the offending noise came.</p>

<p>Katherine and Hazel did not take the additional precaution this time of
alternating as watcher and guard. They stood together at the window, and
as they saw Mrs. Graham open the door they moved quickly to the window
next toward the rear. By the time they reached it, this room also was
lighted.</p>

<p>Fortunately a similar condition existed here also with reference to the
width of the window shade and they were able to get a fairly good view
of this apartment. Mrs. Graham evidently was disposed to lose no time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
and to leave ground for no misunderstanding as to her purpose. She threw
open a second door, this time a closet door, and the girls beheld a
sight that fairly made their blood boil.</p>

<p>There sat little Glen on a chair with a rope wound around his body,
arms, and legs, securing him so firmly to the article of furniture on
which he was seated that he could scarcely move a muscle. His face was
wet with tears and a picture of suffering.</p>

<p>For the first time the watchers observed that the woman had a leather
strap in her hand, and they were still further horrified when they saw
her swing it cruelly against the bare legs of the quivering child.</p>

<p>Once, twice she struck the boy. Hazel and Katherine could hardly contain
their indignation. Indeed it is not at all to be doubted that they would
have attempted to interfere on the spot if an interruption had not come
from another source before the third blow could fall.</p>

<p>There was a disturbance in the front of the house. Somebody had entered
and was talking in a loud voice. Mrs. Graham let her arm fall without
dealing the third blow for which she had raised it as a man entered the
room in anything but mild and pleasant manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing, Mrs. Graham?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;What did I tell you
about this conduct of yours? Do you realize that you are bringing things
to a climax where I&#8217;ll wash my hands of the whole affair?&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker was Pierce Langford.</p>

<hr class="major" />
<div style="margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em">

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2><h3>THE GIRLS WIN.</h3>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Graham looked uncomfortable&mdash;not ashamed or abashed. Doubtless the
conflict within her was between the cruelty of her nature and the fear
of financial reverses in consequence of that cruelty. She did not answer
the rebuke of her confederate attorney.</p>

<p>The latter drew a knife from his pocket and in a moment was severing the
rope that bound the child to the chair. After he had released the boy,
who looked gratefully toward him as a protector, the man threw cold
water on little Glen&#8217;s natural feeling of confidence toward him by
saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, mind you, Mrs. Graham, my interference is not moved by any
sentiment of sympathy for the kid. I merely want to inform you that
things are coming to such a pass that I may be forced to drop out of
this game purely as a move of self-salvation. For instance, it appears
very unwise to make any further attempts to frighten that bunch of
girls. They simply don&#8217;t scare. See that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Langford indicated the object of his question by taking off his hat,
which he had neglected to remove when he entered the house, and
caressing gently with two or three fingers a badly swollen wound on the
side of his head almost directly over his right ear. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span> Graham looked
at it curiously, not sympathetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get that?&#8221; she inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those girls did it, or one of them, I presume. I thought my make-up
would paralyze them, but instead they nearly paralyzed me. I think they
fired some rocks at me, for something of that description struck my
head, and you see the result.</p>

<p>&#8220;I drove my machine into the timber a little farther up the road and put
on my ghost outfit. Then I walked through the woods to the girls&#8217; camp
and stalked past them. You would have thought my appearance was enough
to freeze their veins and arteries. Well, they pretty nearly put mine in
cold storage for eternity. Now, what do you know about &#8216;first aid to the
injured?&#8217; Will you get some cold water and alcohol or liniment? I&#8217;m
going to have a fierce swelling. I don&#8217;t suppose I can keep it down much
now, but I&#8217;m going to have an awful headache and I&#8217;d like to prevent
that as much as possible. Let the kid go to bed, and do something for
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Glen took advantage of this suggestion and went into another room. Mrs.
Graham and the lawyer returned to the living room. Katherine and Hazel
watched them for about twenty minutes, but heard little more
conversation. Then Langford left the house and Mrs. Graham and her son
prepared to retire. As it appeared that they would be able to get no
further information of interest to them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span> at the Graham cottage that
night, Katherine and Hazel and the other two girls who waited at the
edge of the clearing returned to their camp and reported the success of
their expedition.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>Early next day, Miss Ladd, Katherine, and Hazel went by boat to Twin
Lakes and appeared before a magistrate and swore out a warrant for the
arrest of Mrs. Graham on a charge of cruel and inhuman treatment of a
child in her custody. Before leaving Fairberry she had been given
authority to take this move if in her judgment such emergency action
were advisable. She also asked that Glen Irving be removed from the
custody of the Grahams. Then Miss Ladd sent a telegram to Mrs. Hutchins
asking her to &#8220;come at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hutchins arrived at Twin Lakes next day. Meanwhile Mrs. Graham was
arrested and the boy was taken temporarily as a ward of the court. When
she was confronted with the charges against her and the evidence of the
two Camp Fire Girls who had witnessed one instance of outrageous
cruelty, her cold resistance was broken and she promised to accede to
Mrs. Hutchins demands if the prosecution were dropped.</p>

<p>This seemed to be the best settlement of the whole affair, and it was
accepted. By order of court Glen was turned over to Mrs. Hutchins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span> who
assumed the obligation of his care and custody.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hutchins remained with the girls a week at their camp at Stony
Point, and then all returned to Fairberry, where the tents were pitched
again in the broad and scenic ravine known as Fern Hollow. Here they
camped again for another week, summarized, tabulated, and classified the
achievements of the last few weeks, conferred honors, and finally
adjourned to their several homes, there to remain until the autumn
opening of school.</p>

<p>But the adventures of the year for this Camp Fire were not complete.
More of equally stirring character were in store for three of the girls,
and those who would follow these events should read the volume entitled:</p>
